![L06_major_planets](../../attachments/L06_major_planets.png)


- most orbits are nearly coplanar 
- axial tilts vary…

### Solar System Patterns: Orbits

- planetary orbits in ~ coplanar (Mercury) 
- planets’ orbital plane ~Sun’s equatorial plane 
- orbital planes of most satellites near equatorial planes of their planets 
- rotational axes ~perpendicular to orbital plane(Uranus) 
- orbital and rotation directions the same for
planets and most satellites (Venus)

### Orbital Properties of the Dwarf Planets

![A new “category” still to be “filled”](../../attachments/L06_dwarf_planets.png)

### Physical Properties of the Major Planets
![number of known satellites of jovian planets continues to grow; evidence suggests we have found most that are larger than a few km….?](../../attachments/L06_major_planets_physical_props.png)


#### Relative sizes of the planets (and the Sun)

![L06_5](../../attachments/L06_5.jpg)

#### Terrestrial vs. Jovian (giant) Planets 

- Terrestrial Planets
	- located in inner part of Solar System 
	- small 
	- rocky (high density), with distinct surfaces 
	- few moons 
	- no rings

- Giant Planets
	- in outer part of Solar System 
	- large 
	- gaseous (low density) 
	- many moons 
	- rings 
	- rapid rotators
  
### Physical Properties of the Dwarf Planets

![L06_dwarf_planets_props](../../attachments/L06_dwarf_planets_props.png)

### Earth: the prototype of terrestrial planets

- differentiated interior 
- strong magnetic field 
- active surface
	- volcanoes
	- continental plates
	- liquid water 
- atmosphere
	- N, O, + minor amounts of other gases
	- Greenhouse effect (Global warming)
  
### Planetary Interiors How do we know what is inside a planet?

- Seismic waves: requires multiple seismographs on the
surface and an “impulsive” source of the waves:
“earthquakes”, meteor strikes, or explosions (such as
smashing a satellite on to the surface!)
	- The “best” way to learn about planetary interiors 
- Magnetic fields: from a rotating, molten, metallic interior 
- Surface features: continents, volcanos, rift valleys 
- Gravitational deviations: orbits of satellites show
deviations from expected paths due to mass distribution inside the planet

![Earthquake waves probe a planet’s interior](../../attachments/L06_6.jpg)

#### Earth Seismic Waves

![L06_7](../../attachments/L06_7.jpg)

- Refraction occurs – depends on type of wave, frequency of wave, and type and density of material
  - the outer core is fluid
  - inner core is solid
- S Waves cannot pass through the inner core

![Earthquake](../../attachments/L06_8.jpg)


![Earth’s interior is “differentiated”](../../attachments/L06_9.jpg)

#### How are planetary interiors heated?

![L06_10](../../attachments/L06_10.jpg)

- in all cases: heat generated is proportional to planet’s **mass**
  - accretion
  - differentiation
  - radioactive decay

#### How are planets cooled?

![L06_1](../../attachments/L06_1.jpg)

- in all cases: heat escapes radiation through planet’s **surface**
  - convection
  - conduction
  - radiation
  
### Heating vs. Cooling  of planets

- heating mechanisms ~ proportional to mass
(volume) or $\propto R^3$ 
- cooling ~proportional to surface area  ∝R2 
- given two planets of the same composition and density, but different radius… which will cool faster? 
- example: what if planet 1 is twice the radius of planet 2:   $$R_1=2R_2$$
  - heating planet 1 $2^3 = 8 \times \text { planet 2}$
  - cooling planet 1 $2^2 = 4 \times \text { planet 2}$
- larger bodies cool more slowly…will be important
  when comparing SS bodies…more later
  
## Planetary magnetic fields

- a rotating metallic core will act as a dynamo and produce a magnetic field
- Earth’s magnetic field arises from the motion of charged particles in its outer liquid core

![L06_11](../../attachments/L06_11.jpg)

### The Earth's Magnetic Field

![L06_12](../../attachments/L06_12.jpg)

#### The	Position of	the	Earth’s	 Magnetic	North Pole

![L06_13](../../attachments/L06_13.jpg)

#### The solar wind distorts the shape of the magnetosphere
![L06_14](../../attachments/L06_14.jpg)

### aurora = solar wind + magnetic field

![L06_15](../../attachments/L06_15.jpg)

![L06_20](../../attachments/L06_20.jpg)

![L06_21](../../attachments/L06_21.jpg)

### Planetary Surfaces: Earth

- continental drift causes constant change to
surface
  - volcanoes, mountain building, faults, … 
- erosion of surface (water, wind) 
- meteorite impacts 
- sedimentary rocks <-> erosion and water

#### subduction and sea floor spreading: due to plate motion

![Driven by convection in upper mantle](../../attachments/L06_23.jpg)

North America today is the result of many processes such as: 

- subduction 
- collisions 
- volcanism 
- erosion 
- sedimentary deposits

![L06_24](../../attachments/L06_24.jpg)

![tectonic forces can compress or stretch the crust](../../attachments/L06_25.jpg)


#### Tectonic “plates” can slide along each other

![L06_26](../../attachments/L06_26.jpg)


![L06_27](../../attachments/L06_27.jpg)


#### When plates pull apart, crust thins, rift valleys form

![L06_28](../../attachments/L06_28.jpg)

#### Earthquakes occur mostly at plate boundaries
![L06_29](../../attachments/L06_29.jpg)

#### Africa and South America used to be “together”
What is the future of Earth’s crust, continents?

![L06_30](../../attachments/L06_30.jpg)

#### Evolution of Earth

![L06_31](../../attachments/L06_31.jpg)

#### Volcanism
![L06_32](../../attachments/L06_32.jpg)

- An ”upwelling” of molten rock (called magma) from deep within the planet and up through the surface 	
  - From tectonic plates or thermal “plumes”\
  ![L06_33](../../attachments/L06_33.jpg)
- Can cover up old surface features and make new ones 
- Can produce additional gas, introduce into atmosphere

#### Impact Cratering
Impacts produce craters

- (do they appear different from volcano craters?)
- Their features depend on the speed, angle of impact, impactor, surface material 
- Ejecta thrown large distances 
- Small craters are bowl shaped (<5-15 km diameter -  depends on gravity) 
- Larger craters usually show central peak (<100 km) 
- Largest show concentric rings (<300 km) 
- Multiring basins


![L06_34](../../attachments/L06_34.jpg)

### Erosion

- Atmosphere (e.g. wind) and surface water (liquid
or frozen) act to level the surface (remove high
points and fill-in low points) 
- Acts on all scale – large mountains worn down,
small surface features formed, moved, removed.. 
- Chemical reactions as well as moving of material

![Sand Erosion in Sand Dunes](../../attachments/L06_35.jpg)

### Planetary Atmospheres

- origin of planetary atmospheres: at formation? later
from outgassing? 
- loss of atmospheric gasses: <-> T, surface gravity
of planet, mass of gas atom/molecule 
- vertical structure: temperature, pressure, heating…
climate depends on heating, rotation of planet 
- circulation: heating, rotation… 
- Greenhouse effect: surface heating, clouds… 
- CO2 etc. cycles: weathering, precipitation,
chemistry

#### Earth

- Earth’s atmosphere (secondary): original all/mostly
lost 
- atmospheric composition: outgassing, CO2
chemistry, life 
- surface T: combination of solar heating, IR
radiation trapped by cloud layer, hot interior 
- atmospheric circulation and climate: depend on
heating and rotation 
- Earth’s atmosphere is 78% N, 21% O, 0.9% Ar,
0.03% CO2, 0.0018% Ne, 0.00052% He, …
  - CO2 amount has increased by 10% (from 0.0315% to 0.0355%) in last 40 years; cause of global warming?

##### Earth is illuminated and heated by the Sun

![day/night variation depends on rotation speed](../../attachments/L06_37.jpg)

##### Earth’s atmosphere blocks some λ, transmits others

![L06_38](../../attachments/L06_38.jpg)

sunlight received by one hemisphere, reemitted by all

##### Atmospheres have structure
Exosphere: 
	- heated by solar UV + Xray 
	- region of greatest escape (high T, altitude)
 
Thermosphere + Ionosphere: 
- Xrays heat and ionize

Stratosphere:
	- heated by UV light d 
	- no convection

Troposphere:
	- topped by clouds
	- trapping of IR from surface
	- radiation, convection important

![L06_39](../../attachments/L06_39.jpg)

##### Atmospheric structure depends on: T, solar radiation, gravity

![L06_40](../../attachments/L06_40.jpg)


Greenhouse gases main factor in trapping heat

## Greenhouse Effect

![L06_41](../../attachments/L06_41.jpg)


Earth’s atmosphere transparent to visible light (from the Sun) which heats the surface. surface cools by emitting IR light.

Earth’s atmosphere not transparent to IR light: CO2 absorption in IR wavelengths

atmosphere heats up in order to balance the incoming heat from the sunlight. 

Increasing the amount of atmospheric CO2 will increase T

### CO2 cycle details 

increasing by 3.4/yr

![L06_42](../../attachments/L06_42.jpg)

### CO2 cycle acts as a thermostat for Earth through negative feedback
- when atmospheric T is low, less precipitation =>CO2  increases
- when hot, more precipitation => atmospheric CO2 decreases

![L06_43](../../attachments/L06_43.jpg)


![L06_44](../../attachments/L06_44.jpg)


![L06_45](../../attachments/L06_45.jpg)


## Atmospheres lose mass by: thermal escape, solar wind, impacts, condensation, chemical reactions

![L06_46](../../attachments/L06_46.jpg)


### Gas temperature correlates with particle velocity, thus probability of escape

![L06_47](../../attachments/L06_47.jpg)


in  early Solar System, T much greater than at L6 – January present => major atmospheric loss for terrestrial The Solar System and the Earth bodies

### Escape of Atmosphere


- atmospheric gases can escape if
Mass (amu) they have low mass (like
2 hydrogen or helium) 
- since $v_{gas}$ depends on $\sqrt{T/m_{gas}}$,
higher temperature means escape more likely => larger mass gases can escape  
- to retain a gas of mass  m (amu) on a planet with mass M and radius R (in Earth units) the temperature T must be below

$$T_{limit} = 75K \frac{m \times M/M_{earth}}{R/R_{earth}}$$


#### Atmosphere example

- Will a planet with a mass 5x the Earth’s, a radius
10x the Earth’s, and a surface/atmospheric
temperature of 1200 K be able to retain
(molecular) nitrogen in its atmosphere?
$$
T < 75\frac{mM}{R} = 75 \frac{28 \times 5}{10} = 1050K
$$
- The temperature must be less than 1050	K	for
the planet to hold on to nitrogen…  it is 1200	K	
and it is therefore too hot…   answer is NO.

### Atmospheres gain gas due to: outgassing, evaporation, impacts

![L06_48](../../attachments/L06_48.jpg)

### Atmospheric heating: 

- creates a circulation cell in each hemisphere 
- warm air rises near equator and cools as it moves toward the poles 
- then moves toward equator

![L06_49](../../attachments/L06_49.jpg)

### rotation affects atmospheric circulation and a planet’s climate
![L06_50](../../attachments/L06_50.jpg)


- the sun heats the atmosphere near the equator more than at the poles.
- warm gas rises, and moves, but the Earth’s rotation deflects the motion

![L06_51](../../attachments/L06_51.jpg)



- Coriolis effect causes circulation cells to divide 
- on Earth there are three cells per hemisphere 
- gas giant planets also show cells, some have more than Earth some have less…
