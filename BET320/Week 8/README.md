  - CISCO: Given a new idea, Strategy people are all smiling, but the person who owned the execution is not smiling.

Giving him less time to do what part of his work career he was in, he probably valued )
- Sales techniques - Body Language is important
- What is going on people's heads?
- What is necessary and should also be sufficient (you cannot buy a 3 legged horse)?
  - You can have a graph between performance and results to be able to actually show the impact of funding research.
- Are you able to make a coalition, are you able to make numbers, are you able to make customer impact
