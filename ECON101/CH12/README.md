## 12.4 Output, Price, and Profit in the Long Run

*Use the information below to answer the following questions.*

**Fact 12.4.1**

Franklin is a fiddlehead farmer. He sold 10 bags of fiddleheads last
month, with total fixed cost of \$100 and total variable cost of \$50.

**1\) Refer to Fact 12.4.1. If the price of fiddleheads last month was \$15**
per bag, Franklin

A\) should have shut down because total revenue did not cover total
variable cost.

B\) incurred an economic loss of \$135.

C\) made zero economic profit.

D\) made an economic profit of \$50.

E\) made an economic profit of \$100.




---
---
Answer: <sub><sub>C<sub><sub>

---






**2\) Refer to Fact 12.4.1. Suppose the price of fiddleheads is expected to**
stay at \$10 per bag for the foreseeable future, and Franklin\'s
production and cost figures are expected to stay the same. His total
fixed cost consists entirely of rent on land, and his five-year lease on
the land runs out at the end of the month. Should Franklin renew the
lease?

A\) Yes, because total revenue will still cover total fixed cost.

B\) Yes, because total revenue will still cover total variable cost and a
portion of total fixed cost.

C\) No, because total revenue must cover all costs for factors of
production to remain in fiddlehead farming in the long run.

D\) No, because in the long run, zero economic profit is a signal to move
factors of production out of fiddlehead farming.

E\) Insufficient information to answer.

**13\) A perfectly competitive market, with no external economies or**
diseconomies, is initially in long-run equilibrium. There is a permanent
increase in demand. After adjustment to the new long-run equilibrium

A\) the remaining firms in the market will each be producing more output
than previously.

B\) the remaining firms in the market will each be producing less output
than previously.

C\) the remaining firms in the market will each be producing the same
output as previously.

D\) the remaining firms in the market may each be producing more output
than previously, depending on the size of the change in demand.

E\) the remaining firms in the market will each be producing either the
same or more output than previously.

some firms \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the market.

A\) make zero economic profit; exit

B\) make an economic profit; enter

**15\) A market with constant costs is in long-run equilibrium when it**
experiences a permanent increase in demand.

Market supply \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and the market price \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Market output \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and in the long run each remaining firm
makes \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ profit.

A\) increases; falls until it reaches each firms\' minimum average total
cost; increases; zero economic

B\) decreases; rises until it reaches each firms\' minimum average
variable cost; decreases; zero economic

C\) increases; falls; increases; an economic

D\) decreases; rises until it reaches each firms\' minimum average total
cost; decreases; an economic

E\) increases; does not change; increases; zero economic

**17\) Initially, a perfectly competitive market that has 1,000 firms is in**
long-run equilibrium. Then 100 firms in the industry adopt a new
technology that reduces the average cost of producing the good. In the
short run, the price \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, firms with the new technology
make \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ economic profit, and firms with the old technology
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A\) remains the same; zero; incur an economic loss

B\) remains the same; positive; break even

C\) falls; positive; incur an economic loss

D\) remains the same; positive; incur an economic loss

## 12.6 Competition and Efficiency

**1\) Which one of the following need *not* be satisfied to achieve**
allocative efficiency?

A\) Marginal social cost equals marginal social benefit.

B\) The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is maximized.

C\) Price equals marginal social benefit.

D\) Price equals marginal social cost.

E\) Only high-quality goods are produced.

**2\) All of the following statements are true *except***

A\) consumers allocate their budgets to get the most value possible.

B\) we derive a consumer\'s demand curve by finding how the best budget
allocation changes as the price of a good changes.

C\) firms get the most value out of their resources at every point along
a consumer\'s demand curve.

D\) a competitive equilibrium achieves an efficient outcome.

E\) when firms in perfect competition are away from the long-run
equilibrium, the market is still efficient.

**3\) An efficient allocation is achieved when**

A\) consumers are selecting points on their demand curves.

B\) producers are selecting points on their supply curves.

C\) the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is maximized.

**4\) Resources are used efficiently when**

A\) consumers are on their marginal benefit curves.

B\) firms are economically efficient.

C\) price equals marginal social benefit equals marginal social cost.

D\) there are no external benefits or external costs.

E\) all of the above.

**5\) Producers choose \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

Producers are efficient on the market supply curve because
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A\) to produce a good or service only if they will receive a producer
surplus; every point on the market supply curve maximizes producer
surplus

B\) to maximize profit; on the market supply curve scarcity is eliminated

C\) to produce goods and services made with the newest technology; the
market supply curve traces out the same path as a firm\'s marginal cost
curve

D\) to maximize profit; we derive the firm\'s supply curve by finding the
profit-maximizing quantity at each price

E\) to produce goods and services made with the newest technology; every
point on the market supply curve shows the marginal cost of production
using new technology

**6\) Consumers choose \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

Consumers are efficient on the market demand curve because
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A\) to maximize profit; they only purchase goods and services that they
can afford

B\) to buy a good or service only if they will receive a consumer
surplus; every point on the market demand curve maximizes consumer
surplus

C\) to purchase goods and services made with the newest technology; the
market demand curve traces out the same path as the marginal revenue
curve

D\) to allocate their budgets to get the most value possible out of them;
we derive a consumer\'s demand curve by finding how the best budget
allocation changes as the price of a good changes

E\) to allocate their budgets to get the most value possible out of them;
they only purchase goods and services that they can afford

A\) Resources are used efficiently when marginal social benefit equals
marginal social cost.

B\) Competitive equilibrium achieves an efficient outcome.

C\) Competitive equilibrium maximizes the gains from trade.
