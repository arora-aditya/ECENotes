# Prelab 1 Notes
Things I think are important to understanding the prelab

## Laplace transforms

If $f(t)$ is a function in the time domain, then the laplace transform $\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s)$ is in the frequency domain.

$s$ is a complex variable, so $s = \sigma_{\text{(real part)}} + j\omega_{\text{(imaginary part)}}$.
- The unit of $s$ is in rad/s
- The imaginary part is the frequency
- The real part represents a decay coefficient

## Transfer functions

Transfer functions exist in the $s$-plane, not the time plane.

The transfer function $T(s)$ of a system with an input signal $X(s)$ and output $Y(s)$ is just defined to be the ratio of output to input:

$$T(s) = \frac{Y_{\text{(output)}}(s)}{X_{\text{(input)}}(s)}$$

A **pole** is an asymptote in the transfer function.

### How do you get a transfer function?

#### 1. Block diagram to transfer function

There is a direct mapping from block diagram to transfer function:

**Square blocks multiply.** In this case, $Y(s) = X(s)F(s)$.

**Circle blocks sum,** taking into account signs on input arrows. In this case, $Y(s) = (X(s)-G(s))F(s)$.

#### 2. System response to transfer function

You can produce an input $x(t)$ and measure the system response $y(t)$. Then, you can just take the Laplace transform of $x(t)$ and divide it by the Laplace transform of $y(t)$ to get the transfer function.

- If your input is the Dirac delta function (a value of basically $\infty$ for a tiny width of $dx$ followed by nothing), then $\mathcal{L}\{\delta(t)\} = 1$, so the Laplace transformed system response $Y(s)$ is equal to the transfer function.
- If your input is the unit step function (a value of 0 for $x \lt 0$ and a value of 1 otherwise), $X(s) = s$, so the observed system response divided by $s$ will be your transfer function: $T(s) = Y(s)/s$


## Time constant

You gave a unit step as an input to a system and got a response $y(t)$. The time constant $\tau$ is just the $t$ value that decays the unit step response to either $1 - \frac{1}{e}$ times its final value if the function is increasing, or $\frac{1}{e}$ times its final value if it is decreasing.

For example, imagine the response is $y(t) = 20e^{-5 t}$:

The function decreases to its final value 20, so the time constant is the $t$ where its value is $\frac{20}{e}$:

$$\begin{align}
f(\tau) &= \frac{20}{e}\\
&= 20e^{-1}\\
20e^{-1} &= 20e^{-5 \tau}\\
e^{-1} &= e^{-5 \tau}\\
-1 &= -5 \tau\\
\tau = \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}$$

## Gain

Given a transfer function $T(s)$, the gain of frequency $\omega$ is defined as $\left| T(j \omega) \right|$.

$\omega$ is a frequency in rad/s, so you can put any frequency value in there as input instead of using a variable. Remember as well that $|j|=1$.
