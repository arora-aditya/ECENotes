Use the information below to answer the following question.*

**Fact 14.3.1**

Suppose that at one of the Talbot\'s shops, marginal cost of a coat is
constant at \$150, and total fixed cost is \$3,000 a day. The shop
maximizes its profit by selling 15 coats a day at \$500 per coat. Then
the shops nearby increase their advertising. The Talbot shop responds by
spending \$1,500 a day more on advertising its coats. As a result, its
profit-maximizing number of coats sold increases to 25 a day at \$400
per coat.

*Use the information below to answer the following questions.*

**Fact 14.3.2**

Suppose that Tommy Hilfiger\'s marginal cost of a jacket is \$100 (a
constant marginal cost) and at one of the firm\'s shops, total fixed
cost is \$2,000 a day.

The profit-maximizing number of jackets sold in this shop is 20 a day.

Then the shops nearby start to advertise their jackets. The Tommy
Hilfiger shop now spends \$2,000 a day advertising its jackets, and its
profit-maximizing number of jackets sold jumps to 50 a day.

**18\) Refer to Fact.14.3.2. If advertising decreases demand and makes**
demand more elastic, the price of a Tommy Hilfiger jacket
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If advertising increases demand and makes demand less
elastic, the price of a Tommy Hilfiger jacket \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

If price falls, markup \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**19\) Refer to Fact 14.3.2. Tommy Hilfiger uses advertising as a signal**
because

A\) when Tommy Hilfiger advertises, it forces its competitors to
advertise, which raises the competition\'s average total cost and
increases the possibility of the competition incurring an economic loss
and leaving the market.

B\) only firms that can afford advertising have longevity and will be
able to honor any future obligations to its customers.

C\) by spending large sums of advertising Tommy Hilfiger is signaling
that its jackets are high quality.

D\) advertising encourages people to spend regardless of the quality.

E\) advertising always increases demand and creates a more efficient
market.

**20\) Refer to Fact 14.3.2. Having a brand name helps Tommy Hilfiger**
increase its economic profit because

A\) the goal of a brand name is to encourage people to buy just one good.
After the initial purchases, Tommy Hilfiger can decrease quality and
produce goods at a lower average total cost, which increases economic
profit.

B\) in every type of market, consumers are most comfortable when buying
from a firm with a well-known brand name. And the greater the number of
consumers, the greater is the economic profit.

C\) a brand name provides an incentive to achieve high and consistent
quality, and consumers will purchase goods from Tommy Hilfiger rather
than from an unknown producer because they know what to expect from
Tommy Hilfiger.

D\) having a brand name usually leads to a monopoly.

E\) none of the above.
