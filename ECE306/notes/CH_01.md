## Introduction

> **Example**: $n$ identical balls to be separated into $m$ groups. How many ways of separating into $m$ distinct groups, given that each group contains at least one ball for each group

> **Solution**:

> ${n-1}\choose{m-1}$

<br />

> **Example**: $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 100$ How many ways are there?

> **Solution**:

> $99\choose 2$
## The Basic Principle of Counting
Suppose that 2 experiments are to be performed. If experiment 1 can result in any one of the $m$ possible outcomes, and if for each outcome of experiment 1, there are $n$ possible outcomes of experiment 3, then together there are $m \cdot n$ possible outcomes of the two experiments.

|      |      |      |      |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
|$(1,1)$|$(1,2)$|$\dots$|$(1, n)$|
|$(2,1)$|$(2,2)$|$\dots$|$(2, n)$|
|$\vdots$|||$\vdots$|
|$(m,1)$|$(m,2)$|$\dots$|$(m, n)$|

$m \cdot n$ possible outcomes

<br />


**Generalize**: 
Experiment 1 with $n_1$ possible outcomes, for each of them, there are $n_2$ outcomes of experiment 2, for each of them, there are $n_3$ outcomes of experiment 3, ..... then there are totally

$$n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot n_3 \dots n_r$$

possible outcomes of the $r$ experiments
  
## Permutations

**Generally**: for $n$ objects, there are: 

$$n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \dots 2 \cdot 1 = n!$$ 
different permutations

In general there are 

$$\frac{n!}{n_{1}!n_{2}!n_{3}!\dots n_{r}!}$$

different permutations of $n$ objects of which $n_{1}$ are alike, $n_{2}$ are alike, $\dots$ $n_{r}$ are alike

$$n = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + \dots n_r$$

## Combination

In general, selecting $r$ items from $n$ items, then the number of different groups is ${}^nC_{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$


$${}^nC_{r} = {}^{n-1}C_{r-1} + {}^{n-1}C_{r}$$ 


The binomial theorem


$$\begin{aligned}
(x+y)^n &= \sum_{k=0}^{n} {}^{n}C_{k}x^ky^{n-k}\\
        &=\sum_{k=0}^{n} {}^{n}C_{n-k}x^ky^{n-k}
\end{aligned}$$

## Multinomial Coefficients:

$n$ distinct items, are to be divided into $r$ groups of sizes $n_1, n_2, \dots n_r$ $(n_1 + n_2 \dots + n_r = n)$. Then the number of divisions is 

$$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_r!} = \begin{pmatrix}
n \\
n_1, n_2, \cdots n_r
\end{pmatrix}$$

Similar to the binomial theorem, the multinomial theorem is:

$$(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots x_r)^n = \sum_{n_1 + n_2 \dots + n_r = n}\begin{pmatrix}
n \\
n_1, n_2, \cdots n_r
\end{pmatrix}
x_1^{n_1}x_2^{n_2}\cdots x_r^{n_r}
$$
