<p>*<span>Dealing with Deadlock</span></p>
<h2 id="deadlock-option-3-deadlock-avoidance" class="unnumbered">Deadlock Option 3: Deadlock Avoidance</h2>
<p>In examining deadlock prevention, we were attempting to rule deadlock out categorically by eliminating one of the three preconditions for deadlock to be possible. If successful, then we can be sure that deadlock does not occur. Unfortunately, eliminating the pillars came with some conditions and the best we could accomplish was merely making deadlock less likely and not resolving the problem in its entirety. Thus, we are forced to live with a system where a deadlock is possible. However, deadlock being possible is not the same thing as deadlock being inevitable; we can take steps to avoid it if there is a danger of it actually happening. The basic strategy is: do not allow a cycle in the resource allocation graph.</p>
<p>In the dining philosophers problem, one strategy to prevent the deadlock was limiting the number of concurrently-eating philosophers to four, even though the table has five seats. This was a way of preventing a cycle in the resource allocation graph: with only four philosophers and five chopsticks, there were insufficient requests to complete a cycle. This solution is suitable, but not necessarily generalizable to all deadlock situations.</p>
<h3 id="ordering-of-resources" class="unnumbered">Ordering of Resources</h3>
<p>A general strategy to prevent a cycle from forming is to impose ordering on resource requests. Resources are given some order and requests must follow that order. This idea may have occurred seemed obvious from this example:</p>
<p><span>2</span>
<strong>Thread P</strong></p>
<pre><code>     1. wait( a ) 
     2. wait( b )
     3. [critical section]
     4. post( a )
     5. post( b )</code></pre>
<p><strong>Thread Q</strong></p>
<pre><code>     1. wait( b ) 
     2. wait( a )
     3. [critical section]
     4. post( b )
     5. post( a )</code></pre>
<p>Thread <span class="math inline">Q</span> requests <code>b</code> first and then <code>a</code>, while <span class="math inline">P</span> does the reverse. The deadlock would not take place if both threads requested these two resources in the same order, whether <code>a</code> then <code>b</code> or <code>b</code> then <code>a</code>. Of course, when they have names like this, a natural ordering (alphabetical, or perhaps reverse alphabetical) is obvious.</p>
<p>To generalize and formalize this principle, if the set of all resources in the system is <span class="math inline">R = \{R_{0}, R_{1}, R_{2}, ... R_{m}\}</span>, we assign to each resource <span class="math inline">R_{k}</span> a unique integer value. Let us define this function as <span class="math inline">f(R_{i})</span>, that maps a resource to an integer value. This integer value is used to compare two resources: if a process has been assigned resource <span class="math inline">R_{i}</span>, that process may request <span class="math inline">R_{j}</span> only if <span class="math inline">f(R_{j}) &gt; f(R_{i})</span>. Note that this is a strictly greater-than relationship; if the process needs more than one of <span class="math inline">R_{i}</span> then the request for all of these must be made at once (in a single request). To get <span class="math inline">R_{i}</span> when already in possession of a resource <span class="math inline">R_{j}</span> where <span class="math inline">f(R_{j}) &gt; f(R_{i})</span>, the process must release any resources <span class="math inline">R_{k}</span> where <span class="math inline">f(R_{k}) \geq f(R_{i})</span>. If these two protocols are followed, then a circular-wait condition cannot hold <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span>.</p>
<p>In the dining philosophers problem, we assign each of the five chopsticks a number from 0 to 4. Each philosopher must then request them in ascending order. The first philosopher requests chopstick 0, on her left, and then chopstick 1, on her right. The second requests chopstick 1 and then chopstick 2. This continues until the last philosopher who would previously have requested chopstick 4 and then 0, but under the new rules, this is forbidden. This philosopher must instead request 0 on his right, and then 4, on his left. This last philosopher will be blocked when trying to acquire chopstick 0 and it means chopstick 4 will be available for the second-to-last philosopher. Thus, deadlock is avoided.</p>
<p>In <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span> is a proof that ordering the resources prevents deadlock. The approach is proof by contradiction: assume a circular wait is present. Let the set of processes in the circular wait be <span class="math inline">\{P_{0}, P_{1}, ... P_{n}\}</span> and the set of resources be <span class="math inline">\{R_{0}, R_{1}, ... R_{n}\}</span>. The cycle is formed as: <span class="math inline">P_{i}</span> is waiting for resource <span class="math inline">R_{i}</span> and that resource is held by <span class="math inline">P_{i+1}</span>. The exception is the case of <span class="math inline">P_{n}</span>, which is waiting for resource <span class="math inline">R_{n}</span> that is held by <span class="math inline">P_{0}</span> (completing the cycle by wrapping around). Since Process <span class="math inline">P_{i+1}</span> holds resource <span class="math inline">R_{i}</span> while requesting <span class="math inline">R_{i+1}</span>, this means <span class="math inline">f(R_{i}) &lt; f(R_{i+1})</span> for all <span class="math inline">i</span>. But this means that <span class="math inline">f(R_{0}) &lt; f(R_{1}) &lt; ... &lt; f(R_{n}) &lt; f(R_{0})</span>. It cannot be the case that <span class="math inline">f(R_{0}) &lt; f(R_{0})</span>: a contradiction, meaning a circular wait cannot occur.</p>
<p>In development this is usually enforced just by coding convention and code review. If you say that mutexes must always be acquired in alphabetical order (or their order in some file), if everyone sticks to that there will be no issue. Sometimes it’s not that simple, though, because one mutex can be pointed to by two pointers... which name is the correct one?</p>
<h3 id="stay-alert-stay-safe" class="unnumbered">Stay Alert, Stay Safe<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p>Suppose that instead of ordering the resources, each process will need to give the operating system some additional information about what resources might be requested. Processes need to say in advance of execution what is the maximum number of resources of each type they might conceivably need. In a system with a tape drive and printer, perhaps process <span class="math inline">A</span> needs the tape drive first, then the printer, and process <span class="math inline">B</span> needs the printer and then the tape drive. With this knowledge, the system can make more intelligent decisions about when to run a process or make it wait, to avoid getting into a deadlock <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span>.</p>
<p>We say a state is <em>safe</em> if there is some scheduling order in which every process can run to completion even if all of them suddenly request their maximum resources immediately <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>. Hence why we needed to know in advance the maximum resources that could be required by the process.</p>
<p>More formally, there must exist a <em>safe sequence</em>: a sequence of processes <span class="math inline">&lt;P_{1}, P_{2}, ... P_{n}</span> is a safe sequence in the current allocation state if, for each <span class="math inline">P_{i}</span> the resource requests that <span class="math inline">P_{i}</span> can still make can be satisfied by the currently available resources plus resources held by <span class="math inline">P_{j}</span> where <span class="math inline">j &lt; i</span>. If a resource <span class="math inline">P_{i}</span> needs is not currently available, <span class="math inline">P_{i}</span> can wait until all <span class="math inline">P_{j}</span> have finished and releases its resources. When <span class="math inline">P_{i}</span> terminates, <span class="math inline">P_{i+1}</span> can obtain its needed resources and continue <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span>.</p>
<p>Any state that is not safe is considered <em>unsafe</em>. If the system is in a safe state, then there is no deadlock. Being in an unsafe state does not mean that there is a deadlock, but it means a deadlock is possible. The analysis we do is the worst case scenario: every process immediately requests the maximum resources it could ever use. Perhaps the processes do not make those requests in reality.</p>
<p>Consider an example from <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span> in which there are three processes, <span class="math inline">A</span>, <span class="math inline">B</span>, and <span class="math inline">C</span>. Assume there is only one resource, and a maximum of 10 instances exist. Suppose <span class="math inline">A</span> has 3 resources but may request up to 9, <span class="math inline">B</span> has 2 and may request up to 4, <span class="math inline">C</span> has 2 and may request up to 7. There are 3 resources currently free. How do we determine that the state described below is safe?</p>
<p><img src="images/safe-state-initial.png" alt="image" style="width:15.0%" /><br />
A diagram representing the resource allocation state of the system <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>.</p>
<p>Recall that for a state to be safe we need only one path that allows all processes to complete. Multiple solutions may exist, and there may be paths that lead to deadlock. But we need only one solution, such as:</p>
<p><img src="images/safe-state.png" alt="image" style="width:75.0%" /><br />
A diagram demonstrating the state in (a) is safe <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>.</p>
<p>The part of the diagram labelled (a) is the initial state of the system. Imagine that process <span class="math inline">B</span> is allowed to run exclusively, until it gets two more resources, so it now has 4 resources and there is one free, as diagram (b) depicts. <span class="math inline">B</span> is allowed to run to completion, and it therefore finishes and releases its resources to the free pool, shown in (c). Then process <span class="math inline">C</span> is scheduled and gets its full complement of resources, consuming all the elements in the free pool, as in (d). <span class="math inline">C</span> runs exclusively until completion and it releases its resources, shown in (e). Finally, <span class="math inline">A</span> is able to get all the resources and run to completion, too. Thus, we proved that the state is safe: there is a way the system can avoid a deadlock, and run all processes to completion.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, <span class="math inline">A</span> requests and gets another resource. In that case, the initial condition has changed so that <span class="math inline">A</span> has 4 resources and there are 2 free resources. Or, in the diagram below, the state changes from (a) to (b).</p>
<p><img src="images/unsafe-state-initial.png" alt="image" style="width:35.0%" /><br />
A diagram representing the updated resource allocation state of the system <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>.</p>
<p>Given this new initial state (b), we need to evaluate if it is safe.</p>
<p><img src="images/unsafe-state.png" alt="image" style="width:70.0%" /><br />
A diagram demonstrating the state of <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>.</p>
<p>Let us start by attempting to run <span class="math inline">A</span> - there are 3 free resources and <span class="math inline">A</span> would need 6 to continue (because a process immediately takes its full resources when it runs), so it cannot run to completion. The same is true for <span class="math inline">C</span> - it needs 5 additional resources when 3 are available. <span class="math inline">B</span>, however, can continue: it needs 2 resources when 3 are available. If we attempt to run <span class="math inline">B</span> exclusively, it gets its full resources, shown in part (c), and then will terminate and release its resources, as in (d). At this point, however, there is no way to continue; neither <span class="math inline">A</span> nor <span class="math inline">C</span> can get the full complement of resources it might need because there are only 4 free resources. We are out of options; there is no path that guarantees all processes run to completion. Thus, the state is unsafe.</p>
<p>Remember that just because the state is unsafe, does not mean that deadlock is present or certain. The analysis is worst-case: <span class="math inline">C</span> may never need all 7 of the resource and may run to completion with its current 2. However, in an unsafe state, we cannot be certain that deadlock will not occur.</p>
<h4 id="resource-allocation-graph-algorithm.">Resource-Allocation-Graph Algorithm.</h4>
<p>The fourth condition for deadlock is modelled, typically as being a resource allocation graph with a cycle in it. Idea: let us use that idea to avoid deadlock by having the operating system maintain a resource allocation graph. This is applicable if there is only one instance of each resource and still requires that all the resources that a process will require must be declared in advance. However, this condition does not have to be strictly adhered to, if the system allows additional requests only when none of the process’s requests have yet been made.</p>
<p>The model for resource allocation graphs earlier had two kinds of edges: one representing requests (a process requests a resource) and one representing allocation (a resource currently belongs to a process). We will require a new type of edge in the graph: a <em>claim</em> edge, as a way of indicating a process may request a resource at some time in the future, and it is drawn with a dashed line. When the process actually makes the request for the resource, a claim edge is converted to a request edge, and upon release the assignment edge reverts to a claim edge <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span>.</p>
<p><img src="images/resource-allocation-graph-claim.png" alt="image" style="width:25.0%" /><br />
A resource allocation graph showing claim edges <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span>.</p>
<p>A resource request will only be granted if converting the request edge to an assignment edge will not result in a cycle in the graph. There are graph algorithms in code that can be used to detect a cycle (and you may have studied them in a data structures and algorithms class). If no cycle is found, then allocation of the resource will not move the system into an unsafe state. If a cycle is found, the request should not be granted, as it risks a deadlock.</p>
<p>As mentioned, this is applicable only if all resource requests are known in advance and there is only one instance of each resource.</p>
<h4 id="the-bankers-algorithm.">The Banker’s Algorithm.</h4>
<p>The banker’s algorithm is more general: it allows for resources with multiple instances. It received this name because it is hypothetically an algorithm that a small town banker might follow if he or she were trying to prevent allocating the cash on hand in such away that he or she could no longer satisfy customers<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Banks typically lend out more money than they have on hand on the (usually-correct) theory that not everyone will come asking for all their deposits all at once<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the analysis we did earlier to determine if a state is safe or unsafe, is the foundation of the banker’s algorithm. Recall this diagram from earlier:</p>
<p><img src="images/unsafe-state-initial.png" alt="image" style="width:35.0%" /><br />
A diagram representing the updated resource allocation state of the system <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>.</p>
<p>Granting the request from process <span class="math inline">A</span>, the transition from (a) to (b), moved the system from a safe state to an unsafe state. The operating system, when it receives a resource request, will evaluate the new state to see if it would transition the system to an unsafe state. If it would result in that transition, the request will be denied or <span class="math inline">A</span> will be blocked until the request can be fulfilled without putting the system in an unsafe state. Holding to this condition means deadlock will be avoided.</p>
<p>The banker’s algorithm can accommodate multiple resources, as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="images/bankers-multiple.png" alt="image" style="width:60.0%" /><br />
The banker’s algorithm with multiple resources <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>.</p>
<p>The left matrix shows the current state of assigned resources and the matrix on the right shows the maximum number of resources that a process might need to complete execution. At the far right of the diagram is a series of vectors: <span class="math inline">E</span> for the existing resources, <span class="math inline">P</span> for the resources some process currently possesses, and <span class="math inline">A</span> for the available instances of that resource.</p>
<p>The informal approach for checking if a state is safe is described by <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Look for a row in the matrix, <span class="math inline">r</span>, where the unmet resource needs are less than or equal to the available resources in <span class="math inline">A</span>. If no such row exists, the system state is unsafe.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume the process from <span class="math inline">r</span> gets all the resources it needs. Mark that process as terminated and put all its resources into <span class="math inline">A</span>, the available pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until either: (i) all processes are marked terminated and the initial state was safe; or (ii) no process remains whose needs can be met and the initial state is unsafe.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If more than one process may be chosen in step 1, it does not matter which we choose: the pool of available resources will either stay the same or get larger; it cannot shrink.</p>
<p>To determine if granting a resource will make the system unsafe, the operating system should simply perform a what-if calculation. Assume the resource is granted and do the safe state calculation given that new state. If the result is that the state is unsafe, the request should be deferred or denied.</p>
<p>A formal, mathematical description of the banker’s algorithm is defined in <span class="citation" data-cites="osc"></span>.</p>
<p>As great as the banker’s algorithm is in theory, in practice it is utterly useless, as highlighted by <span class="citation" data-cites="mos"></span>. Processes rarely know in advance what their maximum resource needs will be. Also, the number of processes is not fixed, but varies as users log in and launch and close programs and log out. Finally, a resource that was thought to be available can suddenly vanish (a peripheral device is disconnected, the network goes down, a printer breaks...). Thus in practice, the banker’s algorithm can almost never be used.</p>
