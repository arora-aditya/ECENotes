## Significant Digits

- Only show the number of digits that are known 
  - Plus up to one more in calculation, but to be removed (rounded) when showing final answer 
- If you measure something to be 1.6 meters in size
  - but you give the measurement as 1.611309 meters then you are seriously misleading whoever is reading this number.  The ‘11309’ are completely made-up and not truthful.
  
  
## Motion of things in the sky
- Motions appear complex because
  1. motions are not (all) circular 
  2. motions are not in the same plane 
  3. we are on the Earth, spinning and moving


## Naked Eye Astronomy
- What can you determine about the Universe around us
  - With your eyes alone?  no telescope, no photographs
  - perhaps with a time-keeping device and a protractor? 
- Much was known about the Universe – especially
about our Solar System – before the telescope was
invented
- Most of what we can learn comes from making notes
of what we see... especially: 
  - Where things are in the sky and how they move. 
  - Where in the sky is the moon?
  - When is it full?  
  - How is this related to the tides? 
  - Where is Mars?
  - When is Mars bright? 
  
## Constellations
- What are constellations
  - Today, we use the term constellation to mean one of **88** sectors into which we divide the sky, much as the United States is divided into **50** states. The modern boundaries between the constellations are imaginary lines in the sky running north–south and east–west, so that each point in the sky falls in a specific constellation, although, like the states, not all constellations are the same size.

##  Motions in the Sky
- daily rotation of sky (of Earth, really!)
- motion of Moon from one day to next, and
change in “phases”
- motion of Sun from one day to the next
  - hard to notice, because when the Sun is up you can’t see the stars
  - but the Sun is in a (slightly) different part of the sky (with respect to the stars) every night
  - how can you tell that this is true?
    - in practice, we must deduce which stars lie behind and beyond the Sun by observing the stars visible in the opposite direction at night.
- motion of planets
  - The individual paths of the Moon and planets in the sky all lie close to the ecliptic, although not exactly on it. 
  - This is because the paths of the planets about the Sun, and of the Moon about Earth, are all in nearly the same plane, as if they were circles on a huge sheet of paper. 
  - The planets, the Sun, and the Moon are thus always found in the sky within a narrow 18-degree-wide belt, centered on the ecliptic, called the **zodiac**

## Rotation

## Stars
-  Stars appear to lie on a great "celestial sphere" around Earth
- Stars actually lie at different distances than what they appear on the celestial sphere
- Stars make straight lines in a long exposure shot near the equator

## Positions of Objects in the sky

![how high is the sun](../../attachments/L01_how_high_is_the_sun.png)

- How high in “your” sky will an object be?
- We are at a latitude of $44\degree$\
On 21 Dec the Sun is at a declination of $-23.5\degree$ (would
 be seen directly overhead at noon at latitude of $-23.5\degree$).
- how high in the sky (altitude) is the Sun at noon?
  - $altitude = 180 - 44 - 23.5 - 90 = 22.5\degree$
