<h1 id="group-presentation">Group Presentation</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Everyone in the room has used a Windows product, either their Office Suite or their Operating System. Microsoft’s penetration into their customer base has been significant.
While we most know of Microsoft from its Operating System, Microsoft has made significant investments and developments, some of which turned out to be more successful than others.</p>
<h2 id="overall-timeline">Overall Timeline</h2>
<p>Today we are going to be looking at four Categories ……. and analyze using BET320 concepts why they were successful or unsuccessful.</p>
<h2 id="operating-systems-header">Operating Systems HEADER</h2>
<h2 id="operating-systems-timeline">Operating Systems Timeline</h2>
<p>As you can see, Paul Allen and Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975
They got their big break in 1981 when IBM licensed their MS-DOS operating system for their PCs
By 1988, Microsoft had become the world’s largest PC software company by sales</p>
<h2 id="ms-dos">MS-DOS</h2>
<ul>
<li>MS-DOS was incredibly successful and remains</li>
<li>MS-DOS was designed in such a way that it could easily adapt to different hardware, reducing entry costs for potential users</li>
<li>Simple, compact and remarkably robust</li>
<li>It has low minimum hardware requirements</li>
<li>MS-DOS spreads thanks to Microsoft’s aggressive business tactics. They recognized that it was more important to get MS-DOS used on as many computers as possible rather than make a lot of money off any one deal, leveraging the network effect.</li>
<li>MS-DOS provided an open, collaborative platform for software developers to work together to achieve common goals and share findings with each other. This environment increased the network effect.</li>
<li>Microsoft’s deals with IBM and Intel, who bundled MSDOS into their consumer offerings, enabled them to cross the chasm from innovators, the type to assemble their own computers, to early adopters, who bought assembled computer stations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browser-wars-header">Browser Wars HEADER</h2>
<h2 id="browser-wars-timeline">Browser Wars Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li>The creator of Mosaic, founded Netscape Communications and released a new and improved browser, Netscape Navigator . By 1996, they were on the way to dominating the browser market.</li>
<li>Microsoft realized the potential and licensed Mosaic to create the first version of Internet Explorer in 1995.</li>
<li>Microsoft also did a smart move by including the Internet explorer as a default browser in their Windows package. This eliminated the need for the users to decide between purchasing Netscape or Explorer.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer improved rapidly and took over the market by 1999.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browser-porters">Browser Porters</h2>
<p>We can do a 5 force’s analysis on the Browser market!</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitive Rivalry: Only netscape Navigator at that time</li>
<li>Bargaining power of buyers was really low due to Microsoft’s smart move of including their IE for free in the OS package.</li>
<li>Bargaining power of suppliers also played in favour of Microsoft because they were the supplier of their OS</li>
<li>Potential for New Entrants: Since browsers was a new industry, this was undecidable</li>
<li>There was no actual substitutes for browsers at that time.</li>
<li>Also, Microsoft made use of their second mover advantage, licensing Mosaic and using their source code to develop a better version of IE rather than starting from scratch</li>
<li>Even though the browser industry was in rough waters, Microsoft had their assets and resources to fund and distribute the browser in their OS package.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows-phone-header">Windows Phone Header</h2>
<h2 id="windows-phone-timeline-slide">Windows Phone Timeline slide</h2>
<ul>
<li>This slide offers a timeline of how the Windows Mobile offering has evolved</li>
<li>Windows launched their first phone in 2000 and sales peaked in 2007</li>
<li>Windows partnered with and later acquired Nokia 2014</li>
<li>Microsoft discontinues Windows phones in 2017 due to</li>
<li>Low market share</li>
<li>Lack of 3rd party development</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows-phone-porters-5-forces-slides">Windows Phone Porters 5 forces slides</h2>
<ul>
<li>Five force analysis of the market prior to the introduction of Windows Mobile OS</li>
<li>Potential for new entrants and competitive rivalry are high:</li>
<li>because iOS and Android already had a strong hold in the smartphone market</li>
<li>Bargaining power of suppliers and buyers is high:</li>
<li>App developers were the suppliers and they had the power to choose which platform to develop apps for</li>
<li>Customers have many choices, they would move on to a different mobile OS if they weren’t satisfied with msft’s product offering</li>
<li>Threat of substitutes is very low:</li>
<li>Existing substitutes are very inferior</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows-phone-failure-slide">Windows Phone failure slide</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some reasons for the failure of Windows mobile offering</li>
<li>They failed at gaining a first mover advantage</li>
<li>Market was already dominated by Android and Apple devices by when Msft entered the market</li>
<li>Marketing:
<ul>
<li>Microsoft was able to market to users but not to the developers</li>
<li>Msft failed to recognize customer needs:</li>
<li>users wanted more apps that were usable across platforms</li>
<li>Failed to establish partnerships with partners such as Youtube, etc</li>
<li>Windows phones were unable to differentiate themselves</li>
<li>Windows mobile OS didn’t have much exclusive in comparison to its competitors besides the UI</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microsoft-azure-header">Microsoft Azure HEADER</h2>
<h2 id="microsoft-azure-s-curve">Microsoft Azure S Curve</h2>
<p>Satya Nadella actually led the cloud team right before he became the CEO, putting him in a unique position to bring to forefront the prowess of code.
He changed Microsoft’s strategy from ‘Windows first to Windows and’ to reduce the corporation’s dependency on the first S curve. This realisation, has stemmed from the fact the Microsoft was at the tail end of its S curve in the OS era, where is was successfully able to milk out more money from its customers through minor performance improvements i.e. a Cash Cow (since Market share was high, but rate of Market growth was low), but that they needed to diversify to be able to survive.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-azure-partners">Microsoft Azure Partners</h2>
<p>Nadella has managed to enforce the strategy of ‘a more friendly partner, and less of a feared adversary’. This has enabled them to establish closer relationships (Customer Intimacy) with partners, where Microsoft Engineers can be found on on-site working in tandem with Partner engineers. Their biggest wins have come from the retail market where their customers don’t want to drive revenue to AMZ</p>
<p>Sharing is not just for startups, and under Nadella Microsoft has used that strategy to build up on its consumer base.
Nadella has partnered with Adobe, Salesforce, Red Hat, DropBox, and AT&amp;T to name a few.</p>
<h2 id="github-acquisition---everett-roger">Github Acquisition - Everett Roger</h2>
<p>Microsoft has even managed to control disruption on the open-source side of things, where at one point Microsoft’s name was unheard of. The acquisition albeit expensive seems to have evolved from strategy. If we look at Everett Roger’s Diffusion of Innovation we can see that this acquisition along with the Azure’s existing features, really improve the developer workflow</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relative advantage</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper than AWS</li>
<li>More secure, EU guideline compliant for safety and security of data especially under the new GDPR regulations</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Trialability</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Free credits at the start of every Azure account allow the user to get a feel for themselves</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Observability</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Developer hours spent</li>
<li>Azure subscription costs</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Compatibility</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition of Github gives Microsoft an edge to make it inherently more compatible with Azure through one-click integrations with all of its cloud services</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Complexity</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Cross authentication between the two services allows users to use the two websites in tandem make the process appear simpler.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can now clearly see that with these added improvements, Nadella has been successful in driving some cloud revenue away from its competitors by targeting improvements in the developer workflow</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microsoft has seen a series of rises and falls, and its latest bet as a cloud company seems to have paid off. Its successful strategy of partnering, rather than competing has helped it establish itself in the cloud market and make it one of the few companies to be worth over $1T. What remains to be seen is what Microsoft does in the coming years, as its bets on Augmented Reality and Quantum Computing among others materialise into revenue-generating market segments or cash-burning write-offs.</p>
