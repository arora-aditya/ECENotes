## Introduction

- Previous discussions have assumed the CPU is always the bus master and all other devices are bus slaves.
- Sometimes, systems have several devices requesting to be the bus master:
	- Systems with multiple processing units
	- Systems supporting direct memory access (DMA)
- **Bus Arbitration**: A process that selects exactly 1 bus master from one or more devices requesting to be the bus master.
- The following arbitration systems are introduced:
	- 2-Wire Daisy-Chain Distributed Arbitration,
	- 3-Wire Daisy-Chain Distributed Arbitration,
	- 4-Wire Daisy-Chain Distributed Arbitration, and
	- Non-Daisy-Chain Bus Arbitration


**NOTES**

- We need this to determine basically to determine who is in control of the device lines
- We often talk about it in context of the bus master, but it is implied in the slaves in the form of addressing
- It is vital that only one device think that its the master

### Purpose of Arbitration

Primary goal of arbitration is Unique Selection of a bus master

- Possible secondary goals:
  - Fair (round robin, rotating priority, first-come first-serve)
  - Unfair (fixed priority) âˆ— Cheap
- **Non-Pre-Emptive Arbitration**: Once a master has started using the bus it will continue to use the bus until completion. Specific bus structures may place limits on the maximum number of cycles or the maximum time that a master may keep control of the bus.
  - this is because it comes with its drawbacks
  - if you give conrol once, you assume that the device won't take too long and that all will be fine soon
- Pre-emptive arbitration is not considered in this course.



### Terminology for Distributed Arbitration
- **Central Arbiter (CA)**: The component of the arbitration system responsible for detecting that there is a bus request and causing a grant to be issued, if appropriate.
- **Distributed Arbiter (DA)**: The component of the arbitration system that is repeated in each device interface that has a requirement to become a bus master at some time.
- The remainder of this section examines the interconnection of these components.

### Interconnection with the Other Interface Components

## 2-Wire Daisy-Chain
A daisy chain signal is one where you connect devices through other devices.

This was popular for connecting peripherals before CPU's had many ports. You have to assume here that the Distributed Arbiters are working otherwise your devices won't be able to work

### Arbitration System
Cheap, easy design concept but difficult to make it work well
![arbitration-2wire-system](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-system.png){ .responsive-img }

### Central Arbiter
![arbitration-2wire-central-arbiter](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-central-arbiter.png){ .responsive-img }

- Asserts $BusGrant_0$ whenever $BusRequest_0$ is asserted
- Implemented as a simple wire
- Approximately zero delay through the central arbiter ($t_{CA} \approx 0ns$)

<!-- TODO: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE A STATE MACHINE, CAN'T WE ALSO INCLUDE BUS -->

### Distributed Arbiter
![arbitration-2wire-distributed-arbiter](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-distributed-arbiter.png){ .responsive-img }

### Design of a 2-Wire Daisy-Chain Distributed Arbiter
> **Straightforward Cases** - At most one request $\rightarrow$ no arbitration required.

- __Case A__: The local device interface (i) is not requesting service and no lower priority device interfaces are requesting service. The system is idle.
	- All inputs are 0 ($Request_i = 0, BR_{in} = 0, and BG_{in} = 0$)
	- All outputs are 0 ($Grant_i = 0, BR_{out} = 0, and BG_{out} = 0$)
  ![2_wire_distributed_case_A.jpg](../../attachments/2_wire_distributed_case_A.jpg){ .responsive-img }

- __Case B__: Only the local device interface (i) requests service.
	- $Request_i$ transitions from $0\to 1$ causing $BR_{out}$ to transition from $0\to 1$
	- $BG_{in}$ transitions from $0\to 1$ causing $Grant_i$ to transition from $0\to 1$
	- $BR_{in} =0$ and $BG_{out} =0$
  ![2_wire_distributed_case_B.jpg](../../attachments/2_wire_distributed_case_B.jpg){ .responsive-img }
- __Case C__: Only one or more lower priority device interfaces request service.
	- $BR_{out}=BR_{in}$
	- $BG_{out}=BG_{in}$
	- $Request_i = 0$ and $Grant_i = 0$
  ![2_wire_distributed_case_C.jpg](../../attachments/2_wire_distributed_case_C.jpg){ .responsive-img }

> **Cases Requiring Arbitration** - Two or more simultaneous requests.

- __Case D__: One or more lower priority device interfaces request service while the local device interface (i) is using the bus:
	 - When the local device interface is finished, what should happen?
	 - __Case D1__: Forward grant immediately (*Quick solution*)\
   $Grant_{i}$ transitions from $1 \to 0$ and $BG_{out}$ transitions from $0\to 1$
	 - __Case D2__: Re-arbitration cycle (*Best solution*)\
   $Grant_{i}$ transitions from $1\to 0$, $BR_{out}$ transitions from $1\to 0$ (regardless of $BR_{in}$), and arbiter waits for $BG_{in}$ to transition from $1\to 0$ prior to reasserting $BR_{out}$
- __Case E__: The local device interface (i) requests service after a lower priority device interface has requested service:
	 - __Case E1__: If $BG_{in}$ transition from $0\to 1$ has not yet occurred, grant locally
	 - __Case E2__: If $BG_{in}$ transition from $0\to 1$ has occurred, too late to grant locally


**Notes**\

- Sometimes in Computer Science the cost of doing things fast outweighs doing them the best way.
  - If you do manage to service he lower priority quick enough then its fine
- **Case E**: there is a region of uncertainty, where there is a window of time in which we may disobey priority, because of the fact that the distributed arbiter lacks global knowledge of the system.
<!-- QUESTION: Understand the disobeying priority case
ANSWER: THERE exists a time after you forward from device i, and before you actually GRANT to device j (i < j), that device i has a chance to REQUEST, at which point you TECHNICALLY should grant to device i, but since you've already forwarded you've made your bed
-->

#### Case B

__Case B__: Only the local device interface (i) requests service.

  - $Request_i$ transitions from $0\to 1$ causing $BR_{out}$ to transition from $0\to 1$
  - $BG_{in}$ transitions from $0\to 1$ causing $Grant_i$ to transition from $0\to 1$
  - $BR_{in} =0$ and $BG_{out} =0$

![arbitration-2wire-caseB-ladder](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-caseB-ladder.png){ .responsive-img }

The delay through distributed arbiter is shown as $t_{DA}$, and the central arbiter is shown as $t_{CA}$

![2wire4_1](../../attachments/2wire4_1.png){ .responsive-img }


- $Request_1$ is asserted as long as $Device\; 1$ wishes to use the bus
- No arbitration decision is required since there is only one device requesting
- Deassertion of $Request_1$ results in deassertion of $Grant_1$
![2wire4_1a](../../attachments/2wire4_1a.png){ .responsive-img }

#### Case C: Remote Request Only - Propagate Grant

__Case C__: Only one or more lower priority device interfaces request service.

- $BR_{out}=BR_{in}$
- $BG_{out}=BG_{in}$
- $Request_i = 0$ and $Grant_i = 0$

![2wire4_2](../../attachments/2wire4_2.png){ .responsive-img }

**The request path should always increase, and grant paths should always decrease**

![2wire4_2a](../../attachments/2wire4_2a.png){ .responsive-img }

- Request is passed through daisy chain
- No arbitration decision is required since there is only one device requesting

#### Case D1: Remote Request During Bus Use - Propagate Grant
If you propagate the grant, and you only have 2 devices you still obey priority

- __Case D__: One or more lower priority device interfaces request service while the local device interface (i) is using the bus:
	 - When the local device interface is finished, what should happen?
	 - __Case D1__: Forward grant immediately (*Quick solution*)\
   $Grant_{i}$ transitions from $1 \to 0$ and $BG_{out}$ transitions from $0\to 1$
	 - __Case D2__: Re-arbitration cycle (*Best solution*)\
   $Grant_{i}$ transitions from $1\to 0$, $BR_{out}$ transitions from $1\to 0$ (regardless of $BR_{in}$), and arbiter waits for $BG_{in}$ to transition from $1\to 0$ prior to reasserting $BR_{out}$

**Don't try to memorise, try to understand so that you can extend if he actually changes the $t_{DA}$ or other things**

![2wire4_3](../../attachments/2wire4_3.png){ .responsive-img }


Remote is the device further down the chain, while local is the device currently using

![2wire4_3a](../../attachments/2wire4_3a.png){ .responsive-img }

#### Case D2: Remote Request During Bus Use - Re-Arbitrate

![arbitration-2wire-system-caseD2](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-system-caseD2.png){ .responsive-img }

![arbitration-2wire-caseD2-ladder](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-caseD2-ladder.png){ .responsive-img }

If you have more devices in this range, then you sorta see funnel type behaviour in the timing diagram
![2wire4_4](../../attachments/2wire4_4.png){ .responsive-img }

- Despite having a pending remote request, $BusRequest_0$ is de-asserted when $Request_1$ is de-asserted to force rearbitration
- $BusRequest_0$ is reasserted when $BusGrant_0$ is de-asserted
- Re-arbitration forces a distributed arbiter to wait for all higher priority devices to return to an idle state
![2wire4_4a](../../attachments/2wire4_4a.png){ .responsive-img }


#### Simultaneous Requests with 2-Wire Arbitration (Cases E1 and E2)
What happens when DA 1 requests the bus shortly after DA 2 has requested the bus?

![arbitration-2wire-system-caseE](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-system-caseE.png){ .responsive-img }

### Simultaneously Pending Request Signals During 2-Wire Arbitration

- Case E1, $Request_1$ occurs early enough that device 1 gets the bus as if it were the first
to request the bus
- Case E2, $Request_2$ precedes $Request_1$ by sufficient time that Device 2 gets the bus first. This situation means that $Grant_i$ cannot be a simple combinational function of $Request_i$, $BusRequest_i$, and $BusGrant_{i-1}$.
- For Case E2 there are two options to consider:
	- Case E2A: Once $BusRequest_1$ is removed, $Grant_1$ is issued without further arbitration by the Central Arbiter (CA). DA 1 would be designed to assume that DA 2 would release the bus quickly enough for DA 1 to immediately use the bus. This approach (like propagating a grant) does not necessarily obey priority order.
	- Case E2B: Once $BusRequest_1$ is removed by DA 2â€™s distributed arbiter, a re-arbitration cycle is initiated.
	- Note: Assuming non-preemptive service, the arrival of $Request_1$ does not terminate DA 2â€™s use of the bus.

#### Case E1: Remote Request First, Local Shortly After

![arbitration-2wire-system-caseE1](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-system-caseE1.png){ .responsive-img }
![arbitration-2wire-caseE1-ladder](../../attachments/arbitration-2wire-caseE1-ladder.png){ .responsive-img }

<!-- TODO-FOR-SLIDES: ADD IMAGES FOR THE 4 SLIDES HERE -->

### Some Alternative Designs
- Re-Arbitrate for every use of the bus. Option B would require the local unit to ignore all bus grants except if there were a rising edge on the $BusGrant_{i-1}$ signal ... as shown in cases E1B and E2B
- Permit the local arbiter unit to claim bus if all remote (lower priority) devices have no bus request pending\
**What happens if the local device changes its mind?**
  - If the arbiter releases $BusRequest_{i-1}$, but before $BusGrant_{i-1}$ is removed and it quickly reasserts $BusRequest_{i-1}$, there could be 2 bus masters in the system

## 3-Wire Daisy-Chain Arbitration System
- System uses two passive pull-up bus lines and one daisy-chained signal
- Devices may request bus usage quicker

![arbitration-3wire-system](../../attachments/arbitration-3wire-system.png){ .responsive-img }

**Notes**:

- The device asserts request to use, and keeps asserting while you're still using, and when you're done you can de-assert
- BUT here the requesting is way faster because you are not passing through Distributed signal

### 3-Wire Daisy-Chain Central Arbiter

![arbitration-3wire-central-arbiter](../../attachments/arbitration-3wire-central-arbiter.png){ .responsive-img }

- Assert $BusGrant_0$ whenever $\overline{BusBusy}$ is not asserted and $\overline{BusRequest}$ is asserted
- $BusGrant_0$ is computed as follows:
  - $BusGrant_0 = \overline{BusBusy} \cdot \overline{\overline{BusRequest}}$
  - Basically what the signal is saying is that we have $BusRequest$ and we don't have the $BusBusy$
  - The 2 bars on the signals themselves are because of the active-low signals and there is in fact just one inversion required
- Implemented using an AND gate and a NOT gate
- Finite delay through the central arbiter ($t_{CA} \neq 0 ns$)

### 3-Wire Daisy-Chain Distributed Arbiter

![arbitration-3wire-distributed-arbiter](../../attachments/arbitration-3wire-distributed-arbiter.png){ .responsive-img }

- Outputs are a function of both inputs and state
- Arbiter circuit is implemented as an asynchronous (fundamental mode) design
- Finite delay through the distributed arbiter ($t_{DA}\neq 0 ns$)

### Design of a 3-Wire Daisy-Chain Distributed Arbiter
A Distributed Arbiter (DA) associated with any interface wanting to use the bus pulls BusRequest low to request service

- A Distributed Arbiter (DA) may take control of the bus whenever it sees a rising edge on the daisy-chain bus grant signal ($BusGrant_{i-1}$), the bus is not busy ($BusBusy = 1$), and
the distributed arbiter has a local request ($Request_i = 1$)
- The Distributed Arbiter (DA) associated with the interface using the bus pulls BusBusy low to indicate the bus is in use

CASE B

### 3-Wire Daisy Chain Arbitration - Example 1 with Dependencies
![3wire-example1-dependencies](../../attachments/3wire-example1-dependencies.png){ .responsive-img }

<!-- TODO: Understand this diagram above -->

One of the key performance benefits, once the bus busy signal goes back to idle, we can quickly assert the next grant.
\
The Open Collector fundamentally changes the way the arbiter works.

#### 3-Wire Daisy Chain Arbitration - Example 1 with Arbitration and Bus Usage

Same picture as above, but with different layers

![3wire-example1-usage](../../attachments/3wire-example1-usage.png){ .responsive-img }

While one device is using the bus we can significantly start the arbitration process.
In this particular arbitration, once we take control of the bus the bus request goes away, we hold the bus using the bus busy line\
\
BUT we still cannot get full overlap of the arbitration, *but* if there was an extra wire we could imagine acknowledging the request to allow for overlap (i.e. lead to the 4 wire design)

### Note: 3-Wire Daisy Chain Arbitration, Bus Busy - Timing Diagram
- Three devices
- Initially used by interface for device 2
- Requests by interface for de- vice 3 then interface for de- vice 1
- Use by interface for device 1 then interface for device 2

![3wire3_2](../../attachments/3wire3_2.png){ .responsive-img }

**NOTES**:

- Wherever you have a grant signal the BUS_BUSY signal should be low
  - if you take all the grant signal, and superimpose that, and invert that, you will see the BUS_BUSY signal

## 4-Wire Distributed Bus Arbitration

- Arbitration and bus usage may be overlapped by introducing a third open-collector bus signal ($\overline{BusAck}$)

![arbitration-4wire-system](../../attachments/arbitration-4wire-system.png){ .responsive-img }

- $\overline{BusAck}$ is asserted when the next DA to use the bus receives a $BusGrant$

**NOTES**

- Central arbiter still remains the same
<!-- TODO: Since this only allows for the *FIRST* devices that pulls ACK down for queuing, will it disobey priority
ANSWER: Yes, but only if the GRANTs have propagated to the distributed arbiter in the time-->


### 4-Wire Daisy Chain Arbitration - Example 1

![4wire-example1](../../attachments/4wire-example1.png){ .responsive-img }

**NOTES**

- 3 device behaviour is interesting

![4wire-example1-dependencies](../../attachments/4wire-example1-dependencies.png){ .responsive-img }

![4wire-example1-usage](../../attachments/4wire-example1-usage.png){ .responsive-img }


If the system is not idle it will take much longer to figure out which device. The device runs better the more you push it

## Summary of the Operational Characteristics of Daisy-Chained Bus Arbitration

### Monolithic Arbitration System
- A monolithic arbitration system can be built by encapsulating any arbitration system

![arbitration-distributed-vs-monolithic](../../attachments/arbitration-distributed-vs-monolithic.png){ .responsive-img }

- Only the bus requests and bus grants are exposed by the arbitration system
- The number of supported devices is fixed

**NOTES**

- You can embed/abstract the logic of the bus arbitration inside of a computer chip
- if DA1 fails then all corresponding devices fails
  - BUT the thing to note is that even a simple AND gate could fail

### Modelling the Performance of Daisy Chain Bus Arbitration Systems

- To model the performance of daisy chain bus arbitration systems, we will consider the following for 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire systems:
  1. Arbitration delay for both bus idle and bus busy situations
  2. Priority for both bus idle and bus busy situations
  3. Priority uncertainty for both bus idle and bus busy situations
- The following timing parameters are used by the model:
  - **Distributed Arbiter Delay ($t_{DA}$)** The delay between a change in an input to the dis- tributed arbiter and a change in one or more outputs. All distributed arbiter delays are treated the same.
  - **Bus Line Delay ($t_{BL}$)**. The delay associated with asserting or de-asserting a shared bus line. This model assumes that if a bus line is to be driven, it requires $t_{BL}$ time in addition to any other time, most notably $t_{DA}$.
  - **Central Arbiter Delay ($t_{CA}$)**. The delay between a change in an input to the central arbiter and a change in one or more outputs. This delay has been modelled as a constant. For a 2-wire system where the central arbiter is a wire, $t_{CA} = 0$.
- The mathematical model presented is only an approximation


**NOTES**

- Sets up an approximation model to allow for comparison of all of these arbitration devices.
- Makes consistent assumptions across the board

#### Bus Idle
##### Arbitration Delay
- Consider a request by the $n^{th}$ distributed arbiter in a daisy chain
- Assume the bus is idle so the delay between Request and Grant depends only on the
time to decide on the next user
- The delay depends upon the daisy chain arbitration system used:
	- **2-wire**: Delay through n distributed arbiters in the request chain, and the delay through $n$ distributed arbiters in the grant chain ($2 \cdot n \cdot t_{DA}$)
	- **3-wire**: Delay to assert the $BusRequest$ signal, delay through the central arbiter, delay through $n$ distributed arbiters in the grant chain, and the delay to assert the $BusBusy$ signal ($n \cdot t_{DA} + 2 \cdot t_{BL} \cdot +  t_{CA}$)
	- **4-wire**: Delay to assert the $BusRequest$ signal, delay through the central arbiter, delay through $n$ distributed arbiters in the grant chain, delay to assert the $BusAck$ signal, and the delay to assert the $BusBusy$ signal ($n \cdot t_{DA} + 3 \cdot t_{BL} + t_{CA}$)
- For 3-wire and 4-wire, the BusGrant signal is deasserted during bus usage so the time associated with this activity is ignored

##### Priority
- Priority is fixed when the bus is idle:
  - 2-wire: fixed priority starting from the CA
  - 3-wire: fixed priority starting from the CA
  - 4-wire: fixed priority starting from the CA
- When the bus is idle, all systems behave similarly in terms of prioritizing requests
- Since the bus is initially idle, there is no need to consider the potential implications of grant forwarding

##### Priority Uncertainty
**Priority Uncertainty**:
Consider the situation when the bus is idle and there are 2 or more requests:\
If device $n$ initially requests the bus and then device $i$ requests the bus more than $t_{uncertainty}$ before device n should receive the bus grant where $i \leq n$, device $i$ is granted the bus and priority is obeyed

![idle1](../../attachments/idle1.png){ .responsive-img }

When the bus is idle, all daisy chain bus arbitration systems exhibit the same uncertainty:

- 2-wire: $t^{2-wire}_{uncertainty,\; bus\; idle} = (n - i) \cdot t_{DA}$
- 3-wire: $t^{3-wire}_{uncertainty,\; bus\; idle} = (n - i) \cdot t_{DA}$
- 4-wire: $t^{4-wire}_{uncertainty,\; bus\; idle} = (n - i) \cdot t_{DA}$

**NOTES**

- When we have already forwarded grant, and we do get a request on device $i$ before actually granting to device $i+k$ then you're actually granting to the _wrong_ device

##### Note

![idle1a](../../attachments/idle1a.png){ .responsive-img }


- Consider the ladder diagram shown for a 2-wire daisy chained bus arbitration system:
	- Assume the bus is idle, and has been idle for sufficient time to stabilize (i.e., no signal changes are propagating through any of the distributed arbiters)
	- Assume the nth interface makes a bus request at time trequest n
	- Interface i can make a request at any time:
		- If the request is prior to the time marked as CT in
the figure, interface i will become the bus master
		- If the request arrives after CT, interface n will
become the bus master:
			- It is important to note that when the request
from device i arrives the bus is idle
			- It is also important to note that i is the highest
priority interface requesting the use of the bus
			- In this window of uncertainty, n gets the bus
			- The natural daisy chain priority may be violated


#### Bus Busy
##### Arbitration delay
Consider a request by the $n^{th}$ distributed arbiter in a daisy chain:

-  Assume that the current user is the $c^{th}$ distributed arbiter where $c$ may be larger or smaller than $n$
-  Assume that the bus is busy, so the delay (following the completion of the current operation) is related to the time to decide on the next user
-  What is the delay between the completion of one user and the start of the next user $(t_{arbitration,\; bus\; busy})$, assuming that the request by the next user was already present at the DA when the current user finished as bus master?


![busy1](../../attachments/busy1.png){ .responsive-img }

Arbitration delay if the bus is busy:

- 2-wire: $(t^{2-wire}_{arbitration,\; bus\; busy} =(3\cdot c+n)\cdot t_{DA}$ or $(c+3\cdot n)\cdot t_{DA})$

- 3-wire: ($t^{3-wire}_{arbitration,\; bus\; busy}$ ) delay to deassert $BusBusy$, delay through CA, delay through n links in the grant chain including the delay to assert $Grant_i$ and then to assert $BusBusy$. (delays to deassert the $BusRequest$ and $BusGrant$ signals are within the bus usage time and can be ignored here.) ($n \cdot tDA + 2 \cdot t_{BL} + t_{CA}$)
- 4-wire: Assume request is greater than $t^{4-wire}_{arbitration,\; bus\; idle}$ before the bus becomes  so that arbitration selection process is complete before the previous user has finished using the bus. Thus, $t^{4-wire}_{arbitration,\; bus\; busy}$ is just the time to assert $Grant$ and $BusBusy$ ($t_{BL}$)

\
**NOTES**

- we see a good improvement from 3 to 4 is because we can actually arbitrate during the time the bus line is busy

##### Priority
- Priority is fixed when the bus is busy:
	- 2-wire: fixed priority starting from the CA when bus usage completes
	- 3-wire: fixed priority starting from the CA when bus usage completes
	- 4-wire: fixed priority starting from the CA when bus usage starts
- The time at which arbitration occurs is potentially different:
	- When the bus is busy, 4-wire daisy chain bus arbitration systems have greater priority uncertainty since arbitration is fully overlapped with bus usage
	- A 4-wire arbitration system may commit to a lower priority device and then receive a request from a higher priority device while the bus is still busy

**NOTES**

- Notice how 4 wire looks at it from when it starts, while 3 wire looks at when it completes

##### Priority Uncertainty
Priority Uncertainty:
Consider the situation when the bus is busy and there are 2 or more requests:

- If device n initially requests the bus and then device i requests the bus more than $t_{uncertainty}$ before device n should receive the bus grant where $i \leq n$, device i is granted the bus and priority is obeyed. However, in a 4-wire system, the uncertainty window is increased by the time of current user usage since arbitration occurs earlier.
- When the bus is idle, the type of daisy chain bus arbitration system affects the uncertainty:
  - 2-wire: $t^{2-wire}_{uncertainty,\; bus\; idle} = (n - i) \cdot t_{DA}$
  - 3-wire: $t^{3-wire}_{uncertainty,\; bus\; idle} = (n - i) \cdot t_{DA}$
  - 4-wire: $t^{4-wire}_{uncertainty,\; bus\; idle} = (n - i) \cdot t_{DA} + t^{current\; user}_{usage}$

#### Summary of Daisy Chain Arbitration Performance

|| Bus Idle 	| Bus Idle 	| Bus Busy 	| Bus Busy 	|
|-----------	|------------------------	|--------------	|---------------------------------	|-------------------------------------	|
| Parameter 	| $t_{arbitration,\; bus\; idle}$	| $t_{uncertainty}$ 	| $t_{tarbitration,\; bus\; busy}$ 	| $t_{uncertainty}$ 	|
| 2-wire 	| $2\cdot n\cdot t_{DA}$ 	| $(n-i)\cdot t_{DA}$ 	| $(3\cdot c+n)\cdot t_{DA}$ or $(c+3\cdot n)\cdot t_{DA}$ 	| $(n-i)\cdot t_{DA}$ 	|
| 3-wire 	| $n\cdot t_{DA} +2\cdot t_{BL} +t_{CA}$ 	| $(n-i)\cdot t_{DA}$ 	| $n\cdot t_{DA} +2\cdot t_{BL} +t_{CA}$ 	| $(n-i)\cdot t_{DA}$ 	|
| 4-wire 	| $n\cdot t_{DA} +3\cdot t_{BL} +t_{CA}$ 	| $(n-i)\cdot t_{DA}$ 	| $t_{BL}$ assuming selection complete 	| $(n - i) \cdot  t_{DA} + t_{current\; user\; usage}$ 	|


$n, i$, and $c$ are defined as follows:

- $n$ is the device ID of the first DA to request the bus
- $i$ is the device ID of the second DA to request the bus
- $c$ is the device ID of the current bus user

Assume $n > i$ without a loss of generality

#### Non-Daisy-Chained Bus Arbitration Systems
**NOT ON THE EXAM**

A daisy-chained bus grant signal is not a requirement of a bus arbitration system
\
A non-daisy-chained bus arbitration system can be built as a monolithic arbiter:

![arbitration-ndc-monolithic-arbiter](../../attachments/arbitration-ndc-monolithic-arbiter.png){ .responsive-img }
<!-- GOOD-QUESTION: BUT NOT ON THE FUCKING EXAM -->

- At any given time, only one bus grant signal is asserted
- Once a device has been granted use of the bus, it cannot be pre-empted
- A fixed number of devices are supported by the system

**NOTE TO SELF, you stopped listening at this point**

## Questions of Interest: Bus Arbitration Questions

Most questions rely on timing diagram + ladder diagram\

- Terms discussed in this section include: Bus Arbitration and Non-pre-emptive arbitration Priorities in daisy chained bus arbiters.
- What is the key feature of daisy chained arbitration techniques? How is this feature replaced in the non-daisy-chained structure?
- Assume that the delay through a DA is 9ns and that there is a system with 5 devices that may be bus master. Compare and contrast the $t_{uncertainty}$ among the various arbiters for various bus conditions.
- Engineering Questions.
	-  A two-wire arbitration scheme requires the fewest connections and is the best for all uses.
	-  Since 4-wire bus arbiters use more of the available bus time, they are the preferred solution.
	-  The non-daisy-chained bus arbiter is faster than the 3-wire bus arbiter.

## MINI NOTE ON DMAs
**Q** Why do we use DMA?\
**A** We use it so that the CPU does not do dumb work. If you want to transfer a lot data from device to memory, it has to do 2 BUS transactions, which is stupid, so you should design an architecture that allows you to transfer data from device interface and put into memory without CPU intervention or vice versa
