5. Noise margin is lesser, higher voltage between logical 0 and logical 1 might arise, we might need a decoder that would take in the threshold and output the bit pattern
6. ETB is not included in part B, because you don't really need it (SOH implies the previous one ended) {it would be needed if the checksum was of variable size}
  b. SYNC | (SOH + 3 HEADER BYTES + STX + 150 BYTES OF DATA + ETX + 2 BYTES CHECKSUM + ETB) | SYNC = SYNC | 1 + 3 + 1 + 150 + 1 + 2 + 1 | SYNC = 159bytes
  c. The entire data could double because of escaping everyting 309bytes
7. SYNC is 0x16 so that they could get more edges [0x45 is E, 0x43 is C, thus its ECE]
8. Control is also variable in HDLC - 8 or 16 {Bit stuffing in principle should also occur on the address or control even though we know the size, because we still need to maintain SYNCHRONIZATION}

10. He likes true and false for evaluating
