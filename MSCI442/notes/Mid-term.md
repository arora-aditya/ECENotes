this is Group Six's debate video for why
information technology will improve
lives in developing countries I'll cover
a few aspects of how IT information
technology will improve a developing
countries economy politics and social
well-being focusing specifically on
education and health care<br /><br />


first off integrating IT and city
economy brings online services to
developing nations these online services
allow for people to work on various jobs
with little investment required these
jobs include IT services call centers
and Gulf farming and often jobs as such
offer a higher wage and better working
conditions and contrast the local jobs<br /><br />
the availability of these jobs allow for
developing countries to find relatively
high paying jobs without a lot of
capital to create these opportunities in
the first place <br /><br />
another effect that IT
provides is the access to professional
information this information allows for
more effective performance for various
jobs for example a doctor can use
information technology to access
up-to-date research papers not to
mention availability of this new
knowledge is also allowing for new
business opportunities an example of is
this is open source ecology which is the
website that hosts open source
blueprints for various agrarian devices
these blueprints enable developing
communities to build their own tools to
work with with the rise of digital
platforms especially social media<br /><br />

private citizens have been given the
tools to affect political change on a
level like never before
many experts largely credited the take
down of political strongmen all over the
Middle East during the Arab Spring of
2011 - the power of social media and
chat apps such as whatsapp these
platforms empower citizens to quickly
organize and broadcast their message
around the world such as sharing videos
of protests and police brutality these
even went viral and were broadcasted on
global media outlets such as CNN and BBC<br /><br />
on March 28 2018 Chad's government
abruptly cut off access to social media
like Facebook and whatsapp this wasn't
the first time Chad's government has
tried to censor the Internet's an outage
in 2016 began just after the contested
reelection of president adjastabee?
that blockage lasted over ten months
meanwhile this recent 2018 cut off
followed the constituational
changes will allow adjastabee?
to remain president until 2033
<br /> <br />
advocates
for freedom of expression and internet
rights pressure the African Union and
other governments to condemn and
sanction chad's leaders 
<br /> <br />
this Chilean
case highlights the way social media has
increasingly been framed as a threat
especially by authoritarian leaders
internet access is now seen as an enemy
due to its increasing power and
mobilizing political reform <br /> <br />

another
example of the internet society can be
seen in a movement bring back our girls
the kidnapping of more than 200 girls
from their school compound in Nigeria
back in April 2014 by the terror group
Boko Haram resulted in a campaign to
rescue the girls from the captives <br /> <br />the
organisers of this campaign were aware
of the Nigerian government's notoriety
in disregarding the lives of its
citizens the campaign had started with a
march on the Nigerian Parliament
building in Abuja on the 30th of April
and two weeks later a social media
campaign with the hashtag
bringbackourgirls<br /> <br />
the campaign and the hashtag would go on
to catch the attention of the rest of
the world with international
personalities and public figures like
Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey quickly
identifying with the hashtag and
supporting the campaign <br /> <br />within two weeks
of starting the online campaign the set
hashtag has been tweeted and retweeted
more than a million times and several
mass rallies took place in their country
and around the world including those
stationed from the defense headquarters
in Abuja the Nigerian sea of governments
and the embassies of the country in
London Los Angeles and New York<br /> <br /> this put
immense pressure on the Nigerian
authorities to keep the responsibility
of finding and reuniting that kidnapped
grouse with their parents <br /><br /> <br /> 
public
interest in electoral processes and
political engagement are central to
democratic governance all engagement
ensures the sustenance of democracy's
had also deepens the roots of popular
votes in young democracies<br /> <br /> in Kenya
traditional media particularly radio
have powerful roles in political
mobilization and participation <br /> <br />since the
liberalisation of broadcast media in the
late 1980s privately-owned media
operations have expanded in Kenya
resulting in a variety of voices and
perspectives on nearly 200 radio
stations broadcasts are in English and
local languages many of which allows
listeners to participate
which may increase their sense of
efficacy and validate their perspectives<br /> <br />
Kenyan media plays an important role in
providing political information and
setting the agenda for political
discourse <br /> <br />a study examining the
relationship between media use and
political engagement in the United
States Kenya and Nigeria found that
accessing political information via
social media has also been found to be
associated with enhanced social capital
online political expression and offline
political activities including voting
and volunteering in campaigns <br /> <br />likewise
it was found a Nigerian students who
spend more time on social media are
likely to participate in campaigns
during elections<br /> <br /><br /> <br /> information technology
is directly responsible for the
increased access to health care in
developing countries we see this in
three main applications of IT <br /> <br />number one
receiving health text messages short
message service SMS are now being widely
used to educate people and provide them
with health information on viruses
diseases and best practices. <br /> <br />In
Bangladesh expectant mothers can often
to receive twice weekly SMS reminders
about checkups medication and nutrition
guidelines <br /> <br />across Africa text messages
and local dialects are sent to cell
phone users to tell them about
vaccination programs malaria prevention
as well as valuable education on drug
abuse researchers from the University of
Oxford recently conducted the first
systematic study of mobile phone use
during an illness in rural China and
India this is conclusive proof that cell
phone use is associated with better
access to health care <br /> <br />number two medical
examinations in remote areas in areas
where there might be no running water or
electricity but there is a mobile signal
medical examinations are conducted
through IT <br /> <br />in Botswana local health
workers take images of skin rashes of
HIV patients and cervical cancer
patients using their mobile phones which
is able to digitalize the image and
transmit it via satellite to a remote
specialized facility that can analyze
that within half an hour
potentially saving the life of the
user this does not require a laboratory
or medical equipments <br /> <br />number three
healthcare administrative systems mobile
technology can also help countries
leapfrog the design of their healthcare
administrative systems the use of mobile
technology and the
resulting move away from paper has increased
accuracy and reduced time and costs of
information for example babies born
outside hospitals can now be accounted
for in Nigeria and in Uganda using SMS<br /> <br />
all delays for receiving test results
for HIV has been cut down from 45 days
down to 2 in Zambia and Malawi<br /> <br />
furthermore when combined with open
access mobile health can increase
transparency and accountability of
government and delivering health care
using their phones patients in rural
areas can now report absenteeism or
corruption <br /> <br />internet access in developing
countries has also enabled an explosive
increase in literacy rates volume of
students were enrolled in the education
facility and ease of access to education<br /> <br />
students in developing countries can
access foreign teachers especially for
subjects where local teachers are under
qualified or unavailable <br /> <br />online schools
reduce the barrier to access education
in remote areas <br /> <br />unesco suggests a
directly proportional relationship
between education levels and IT access
in developing countries this can be seen
through this world map that places
literacy levels in each country versus
internet connection <br /> <br />google c-squared
fiber-optics initiative to provide
broadband infrastructure has increased
the network footprint in Kenya, Liberia,
Ghana and Uganda results in
significantly higher literacy rates in
these areas <br /> <br />adults aged 15 and above as
of the year 2018 has increased the
literacy rates to 82% from 79% four
years ago in 2014
Ghana used to have the literacy rate of
71.5% and increased that to 79% from
2010 to 2018 there are various ways IT
cannon has been improving lives in
developing countries as we covered today
technology enables a stronger and safer
economy through the creation of IT
related jobs spreads political awareness
and promotes reform and is directly
correlated to better health care and
education

from Team 21 and today we'll be
<br /><br />00:05
exploring the impact of information
<br /><br />00:06
technology on developing countries we
<br /><br />00:11
will be making the argument that
<br /><br />00:12
information technology will not improve
<br /><br />00:14
the lives of people in developing
<br /><br />00:16
countries firstly it's important to
<br /><br />00:19
understand the definition of information
<br /><br />00:21
technology Oxford Dictionary defines it
<br /><br />00:24
as a study or use of systems especially
<br /><br />00:27
computers and telecommunications for
<br /><br />00:29
storing retrieving and sending
<br /><br />00:31
information examples of these include
<br /><br />00:33
computers phones TVs flash drives and
<br /><br />00:36
computer networks the main arguments
<br /><br />00:40
that we will be using to support our
<br /><br />00:42
position are broken up into eight
<br /><br />00:44
different themes the digital divide
<br /><br />00:46
economy gender and age inequality
<br /><br />00:49
politics culture security infrastructure
<br /><br />00:53
requirements and training and
<br /><br />00:54
qualifications introducing new
<br /><br />00:58
technology will have a negative impact
<br /><br />01:00
on the digital divide as developing
<br /><br />01:02
countries adopt new technologies these
<br /><br />01:04
will be used to reinforce the gap
<br /><br />01:06
between rich and poor in addition
<br /><br />01:08
developing countries might not have the
<br /><br />01:09
capabilities needed to take advantage of
<br /><br />01:12
the potential that new technologies hold
<br /><br />01:14
for improving processes and products an
<br /><br />01:17
example of the digital divide can be
<br /><br />01:19
seen by looking at the least and most
<br /><br />01:21
connected countries typically
<br /><br />01:23
introduction of new technologies works
<br /><br />01:25
best with the countries that are well
<br /><br />01:27
connected building the building the
<br /><br />01:29
required infrastructure to connect
<br /><br />01:31
countries to the Internet it's expensive
<br /><br />01:32
and therefore a few developing countries
<br /><br />01:35
can afford this computer hardware and
<br /><br />01:37
access to the Internet is not affordable
<br /><br />01:39
for most people in developing countries
<br /><br />01:40
and a lack of electricity is common in
<br /><br />01:43
rural areas only the most privileged
<br /><br />01:46
will be able to access the Internet and
<br /><br />01:47
receive the benefits extending the gap
<br /><br />01:49
between the rich and the poor developing
<br /><br />01:52
countries also might not have the
<br /><br />01:54
capabilities needed to take advantage of
<br /><br />01:56
the potential that new technologies hold
<br /><br />01:58
for improving processes and products in
<br /><br />02:02
addition to the digital divide new
<br /><br />02:04
technology can impose negative risks of
<br /><br />02:06
the economies of developing countries
<br /><br />02:08
this ranges from employment to job
<br /><br />02:10
destruction and poverty regarding
<br /><br />02:13
employee
<br /><br />02:13
a literature review was conducted in
<br /><br />02:15
2014 on the potential effects of
<br /><br />02:17
technological change which showed that
<br /><br />02:19
technological innovation negatively
<br /><br />02:21
impacts economies when the skill
<br /><br />02:23
category is unskilled labor furthermore
<br /><br />02:26
an important contributor to the hot to
<br /><br />02:28
the higher inequality observed in
<br /><br />02:30
developing countries are skill based
<br /><br />02:32
technical changes which is a shift in
<br /><br />02:34
the production technology that favors
<br /><br />02:36
skilled / unskilled labor by increasing
<br /><br />02:39
its relative productivity thus
<br /><br />02:41
increasing relative demand although
<br /><br />02:43
developing countries have skills scarce
<br /><br />02:45
these economies still favor skilled
<br /><br />02:47
workers which ultimately affects the
<br /><br />02:49
pervasive increase in wage inequality if
<br /><br />02:53
we take a look at the textile and
<br /><br />02:54
clothing industries in developing
<br /><br />02:56
countries imposing technology has
<br /><br />02:58
introduced a number of negative
<br /><br />02:59
challenges machines and automation
<br /><br />03:01
systems can replace employment roles by
<br /><br />03:03
decreasing the need for manual human
<br /><br />03:06
labor industrial automation is highly
<br /><br />03:08
dependent on information technology and
<br /><br />03:10
often includes databases simulation
<br /><br />03:13
communication optimization scheduling
<br /><br />03:15
etc if developing nations do not
<br /><br />03:19
moderate their influence on technology
<br /><br />03:21
advancement rapid changes in unstable
<br /><br />03:23
environments will lead to
<br /><br />03:24
destabilization and cause more problems
<br /><br />03:26
than they solve developing nations who
<br /><br />03:28
want to advance technologically require
<br /><br />03:30
working individuals to have technical
<br /><br />03:32
expertise however there needs to be
<br /><br />03:34
proper infrastructure in place to
<br /><br />03:36
support these advancements some of the
<br /><br />03:38
poor infrastructure includes educational
<br /><br />03:41
systems that produce graduates with
<br /><br />03:43
without a satisfactory background
<br /><br />03:45
families not being able to afford to
<br /><br />03:47
send their children to school and a lack
<br /><br />03:49
of resources and educational
<br /><br />03:50
institutions there is proof that
<br /><br />03:53
introducing information technology to
<br /><br />03:55
developing countries will have a
<br /><br />03:56
negative impact on gender and age
<br /><br />03:58
equality it's important for governments
<br /><br />04:00
and businesses in developing countries
<br /><br />04:02
to ensure the use of information
<br /><br />04:04
technology boosts Rather's rather than
<br /><br />04:07
hinders their development and there is a
<br /><br />04:09
growing risk that automation is
<br /><br />04:11
beginning to pose a threat to women's
<br /><br />04:13
jobs in particular and cause a bias in
<br /><br />04:15
favor of male workers based on a recent
<br /><br />04:19
report by the london-based International
<br /><br />04:20
Institute for Environment and
<br /><br />04:23
development the increase of automation
<br /><br />04:25
is beginning to leave large number
<br /><br />04:27
is unemployed and is hence widening the
<br /><br />04:29
inequality gaps the Institute's director
<br /><br />04:31
said that what we're seeing now is the
<br /><br />04:33
emergence of technologies which are
<br /><br />04:35
likely to mean that there will be less
<br /><br />04:37
market for simple industrial workers in
<br /><br />04:39
poorer countries because of automation
<br /><br />04:41
and the sectors in the front of the
<br /><br />04:44
front line of the next wave of
<br /><br />04:45
automation included call centers which
<br /><br />04:48
have provided a large number of jobs for
<br /><br />04:50
women in some countries this report
<br /><br />04:52
warns that the impact of automation can
<br /><br />04:55
have a sharply negative impact on gender
<br /><br />04:57
inequality there have also been some
<br /><br />04:59
studies on gender to show that women
<br /><br />05:01
especially in developing countries are
<br /><br />05:03
much less likely to work in IT sectors
<br /><br />05:06
because they are less likely to receive
<br /><br />05:08
education in STEM subjects it has been
<br /><br />05:12
argued that younger generations are more
<br /><br />05:14
productive than older ones as they are
<br /><br />05:16
able to keep up with new technologies
<br /><br />05:17
better through the educational system
<br /><br />05:19
and that in this sense technology will
<br /><br />05:21
be more biased towards younger people
<br /><br />05:23
it's important for developing nations to
<br /><br />05:25
take this all into account when
<br /><br />05:27
introducing new information technology
<br /><br />05:29
methods in a lot of developing countries
<br /><br />05:32
controls imposed by the government
<br /><br />05:34
hamper the spread of IT these controls
<br /><br />05:36
limit the benefits of IT from reaching
<br /><br />05:39
the residents of those countries and
<br /><br />05:40
also violates fundamental human rights
<br /><br />05:43
such as a right to information and the
<br /><br />05:45
right to privacy the governments of
<br /><br />05:47
these countries are missing misusing IT
<br /><br />05:49
and it's popularity to turn the
<br /><br />05:51
country's residence in their favor in
<br /><br />05:54
democratic countries like China the
<br /><br />05:56
government bans any internet content
<br /><br />05:58
that might hurt the reputation of the
<br /><br />06:00
political party in power or the
<br /><br />06:01
reputation of the country due to this
<br /><br />06:03
the residents of China are restricted
<br /><br />06:05
from accessing any information that
<br /><br />06:07
might cause them to protest against the
<br /><br />06:09
government thus disobeying the
<br /><br />06:11
fundamentals of democracy furthermore
<br /><br />06:13
rules enforcing that Internet service
<br /><br />06:15
and content providers maintain records
<br /><br />06:17
of the information they've published and
<br /><br />06:19
the users they've reached over the past
<br /><br />06:21
two months also violates the right to
<br /><br />06:23
privacy non democratic countries like
<br /><br />06:26
most countries in the Middle East also
<br /><br />06:29
restrict the information that users have
<br /><br />06:30
access to via the Internet which poses
<br /><br />06:33
as an obstacle preventing the benefits
<br /><br />06:35
of IT from reaching users further
<br /><br />06:37
blocking the development of these
<br /><br />06:38
countries some other examples
<br /><br />06:41
South Koreans being forbidden from
<br /><br />06:43
making any contact with North Korea as
<br /><br />06:45
well as the Canadian government
<br /><br />06:47
considering applying regulations to
<br /><br />06:49
provide more Canadian content on the
<br /><br />06:52
Internet while globalization and spread
<br /><br />06:55
of information by IT can increase
<br /><br />06:57
cultural awareness and promote diversity
<br /><br />06:59
it can also lead to cultures of
<br /><br />07:02
developing countries being overpowered
<br /><br />07:04
by those of more influential countries
<br /><br />07:06
developing countries are faced with the
<br /><br />07:08
risk of losing their own cultural
<br /><br />07:09
identities while being swept into the
<br /><br />07:12
worldwide trends of moving towards an
<br /><br />07:14
increasingly westernized world while IT
<br /><br />07:18
helps circulate a vast variety of
<br /><br />07:20
information it also spreads adversities
<br /><br />07:22
like misrepresentation and stereotyping
<br /><br />07:24
in addition influential multinational
<br /><br />07:27
corporations can promote a consumer
<br /><br />07:29
culture making oppressive trends like
<br /><br />07:31
exploitation of workers commonplace
<br /><br />07:34
spread of such cultural views of the
<br /><br />07:36
first world nations can drown out local
<br /><br />07:38
cultural influences in developing
<br /><br />07:40
countries leading to a risk of losing
<br /><br />07:42
cultural diversity before new
<br /><br />07:46
technologies introduced a country should
<br /><br />07:48
have sound cybersecurity laws and
<br /><br />07:50
regulations cyber security education and
<br /><br />07:53
cyber security infrastructure without
<br /><br />07:55
these introduction and new technologies
<br /><br />07:57
can be harmful a recent report
<br /><br />07:59
sanctioned by the Africa cybersecurity
<br /><br />08:02
conference
<br /><br />08:02
estimates that the continent lost about
<br /><br />08:04
3.7 billion dollars to cybercrime in
<br /><br />08:07
2017 and that more than 90% of African
<br /><br />08:10
businesses couldn't adequately protect
<br /><br />08:12
themselves against cybercrime losses
<br /><br />08:14
given the levels of poverty in
<br /><br />08:16
developing nations populations lack the
<br /><br />08:19
ability to bounce back and recover from
<br /><br />08:20
exploitation especially threats in
<br /><br />08:23
cyberspace in 2017 it is estimated that
<br /><br />08:26
Nigeria's economy lost
<br /><br />08:28
650 million dollars due to cyber crime
<br /><br />08:32
the 200 million dollar African Union
<br /><br />08:36
Commission headquarters opened in 2012
<br /><br />08:38
and that was funded entirely by the
<br /><br />08:40
Chinese government it was called China's
<br /><br />08:42
gift to Africa yet in January of 2017 a
<br /><br />08:46
computer scientist at the African Union
<br /><br />08:48
noticed that a you servers from midnight
<br /><br />08:51
to 2:00 a.m. we're sending large volumes
<br /><br />08:53
of data from the organ
<br /><br />08:55
to servers servers in Shanghai it
<br /><br />08:58
occurred every night from January 2012
<br /><br />09:00
through January 2017 cybersecurity
<br /><br />09:03
ecosystem should include effective cyber
<br /><br />09:06
laws and regulations cybersecurity
<br /><br />09:08
awareness as well as online child
<br /><br />09:09
protection cybersecurity education is
<br /><br />09:12
also important but in many of these
<br /><br />09:14
countries there are no government-funded
<br /><br />09:15
IT security courses available and other
<br /><br />09:18
IT security certifications are expensive
<br /><br />09:21
upgrading infrastructures can strengthen
<br /><br />09:23
cyber security but is often neglected
<br /><br />09:25
ensuring the technology is up-to-date by
<br /><br />09:28
security updates and regular maintenance
<br /><br />09:30
is integral to keeping the data secure
<br /><br />09:33
without these core elements of cyber
<br /><br />09:35
security in place introducing new
<br /><br />09:37
technology exposes users to a world of
<br /><br />09:40
threats developing countries need but
<br /><br />09:43
often don't have regulations and
<br /><br />09:45
infrastructure to defend against data
<br /><br />09:47
theft from malware criminals and
<br /><br />09:49
malicious intent from foreign investors
<br /><br />09:54
infrastructure requirements is yet
<br /><br />09:55
another theme for why the introduction
<br /><br />09:57
of IT into developing countries has
<br /><br />10:00
negative impacts poor IT infrastructure
<br /><br />10:03
is a major cause of failures for efforts
<br /><br />10:06
to facilitate the transfer of technology
<br /><br />10:08
to developing countries IT transferred
<br /><br />10:10
development and implementation is
<br /><br />10:12
inaccessible due to the lack of a sound
<br /><br />10:14
infrastructure to build on information
<br /><br />10:17
technology not only includes the
<br /><br />10:19
hardware like computers and phones but
<br /><br />10:21
it also includes IT personnel needed to
<br /><br />10:23
operate the systems without these
<br /><br />10:25
personnel the IT infrastructure can fail
<br /><br />10:28
to operate in an effective manner access
<br /><br />10:32
to information technology resources is
<br /><br />10:34
scarce in developing countries
<br /><br />10:36
connections to the Internet and
<br /><br />10:37
telephone are unreliable and found
<br /><br />10:39
mainly in major cities however rural
<br /><br />10:42
areas are primarily disconnected in 2012
<br /><br />10:46
data on internet usage shows that while
<br /><br />10:48
Africa had an estimated population of
<br /><br />10:50
about 1 billion the Internet usage was
<br /><br />10:53
at about 167 million which is about 15.6
<br /><br />10:58
percent of their population this chart
<br /><br />11:01
shows a similar pattern in other
<br /><br />11:03
developing countries as well
<br /><br />11:07
to facilitate the introduction of IT to
<br /><br />11:10
these unconnected regions is a huge
<br /><br />11:12
investment as it would be expensive and
<br /><br />11:14
take a considerable amount of time to
<br /><br />11:17
build the infrastructure from scratch
<br /><br />11:18
the transfer of Technology isn't a
<br /><br />11:21
passive act it requires for the route
<br /><br />11:23
for the recipient to improve and build
<br /><br />11:25
their current infrastructure to
<br /><br />11:26
successfully adopt the information
<br /><br />11:28
technology the last theme that we'll be
<br /><br />11:31
talking about where information
<br /><br />11:33
technology can have negative impacts on
<br /><br />11:35
developing countries is training and
<br /><br />11:37
qualifications training and
<br /><br />11:40
qualifications are necessary
<br /><br />11:41
requirements for the adoption of
<br /><br />11:43
technology developing countries
<br /><br />11:45
generally lack people who are skilled in
<br /><br />11:47
IT work to design install configure and
<br /><br />11:49
maintain the technology that is
<br /><br />11:51
introduced to the public the transfer of
<br /><br />11:55
technology cannot occur by simply
<br /><br />11:57
trained a few individuals the necessary
<br /><br />11:59
technical skills or importing advanced
<br /><br />12:01
technology to a country researchers judo
<br /><br />12:05
and Idaho have noted that the transfer
<br /><br />12:07
of technology only happens when the
<br /><br />12:09
country has the technological
<br /><br />12:10
information that is required to maintain
<br /><br />12:12
and use it in an effective way
<br /><br />12:15
relocating technology is an easy task
<br /><br />12:17
but developing countries generally don't
<br /><br />12:19
have enough qualified professionals to
<br /><br />12:21
support it
<br /><br />12:23
so based on our many different arguments
<br /><br />12:26
in the eight themes that we have
<br /><br />12:28
discussed we strongly believe that
<br /><br />12:30
information technology will not improve
<br /><br />12:33
the lives of people in developing
<br /><br />12:34
countries
<br /><br />12:37
thank you
<br /><br />12:44
you
