<p><strong>Why Serial?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the least complex electrical interface between digital devices.</li>
<li>Use a single wire (plus ground) to carry information - one symbol (one bit in the simplest case) at a time.</li>
<li>wires get expensive as you increase the distance, if any one breaks the communication is broken</li>
<li>thickness of the wire is also less which makes it convenient to carry around and use</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard for communication between the two connected devices should match for Serial interfacing to make any sense</p>

<h3 id="duplexing-in-channels">Duplexing in Channels</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplex</strong>: unidirectional as shown below</li>
<li><strong>Half Duplex</strong>: bidirectional, one-way at a time, as shown below
<ul>
<li>Phones for a long while worked like this, to preserve bandwidth, and there was only uni-directional flow of data, Walkie-Talkies have the Push to Talk buttons which generally use Half Duplex</li>
<li>Eg: a productive lecture is a half-duplex where instructor talks and student listens and vice versa, a conversation between 2 people</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Full Duplex</strong>: simultaneous bidirectional, as shown below
<ul>
<li>sometimes interference can lead to crosstalk but there are ways to minimise this</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="classes-of-synchronization">Classes of Synchronization</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bit Synchronization</strong>: How long is each bit? and Where do bits start (or stop)? These two components may be considered separately.
<ul>
<li><em>Bit Rate Synchronization</em>: The time that elapses between the start of one bit and the start of the next bit.</li>
<li><em>Phase Synchronization</em>: Given that the rate is known, how is the mid-point (or start) of each (or any) bit found. This amounts to determining the phase relationship between the local clock and the clock used to transmit the data originally.
<ul>
<li>if you sample them at the wrong time then you would get garbage data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Byte Synchronization</strong>: Where do bytes start and stop?</li>
<li><strong>Block Synchronization</strong>: Where do blocks start and stop?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ex3">EX3</h5>
<p>Given an input signal and a clock as shown below: The clock provides one way to get the bit timing, if we assume rising edge then bit synchronization has been attained and the bits can be reliably interpreted. 16, - 0110111001101010</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>Bit per second (Bit Rate) vs Baud (or Baud Rate).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bit Rate</strong>: The number of bits that can be transferred per second over a channel.</li>
<li><strong>Baud Rate</strong>: The maximum number of symbols that can be transferred per second over a channel.<br />
Consider the following figure
<img src="../../attachments/bitbaud.png" alt="bitbaud" class="responsive-img" /></li>
</ul>
<p>We generally assume that wire can only be 0 or 1, but in the above you can see how the diagram of how “multiple” bits are transferred at the same time, using different voltage levels</p>
<h4 id="implementation-issues---data-representation-as-electrical-signals">Implementation Issues - Data Representation as Electrical Signals</h4>
<ul>
<li>Note: Coding schemes that do not have a zero rest point are referred to as an NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) code.</li>
<li>One could characterize on parameters such as: Ease of design, the presence of a DC component, use of bandwidth and synchronization possibilities.</li>
<li>(Also in Wakerly)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../attachments/serial13.png" alt="serial13" class="responsive-img" /><br />
<strong>NRZ - Non-Return-to-Zero</strong><br />
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ON/OFF: Oscillates between 0V and XV (where X=3.3 or 5 or 12)</li>
<li>Bipolar: Oscillates between -YV to YV (where Y=3.3 or 5 or 12)
<ul>
<li>quite better because you see the current change direction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NRZI(inverted or interval): 1 means EDGE
<ul>
<li>how is this synchronized: we need a clock signal, because you need to know where the bits start and stop
<img src="../../attachments/differential_and_NRZI.png" alt="differential_and_NRZI" class="responsive-img" /></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RZ - Return-to-Zero</strong><br />
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ON/OFF: If you get a long list of 0’s then you lose synchronization
<ul>
<li>not as big a problem in real life because we alternate often</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Manchester (Split Phase): 0 is represented by a rising edge, and 1 is represented by a falling edge, i.e. always goes to zero
<ul>
<li>two views: where they actually switch the bits, moreover some accepted standards have the switched representations</li>
<li>Why do you care about middle of bits: Arrival of clock edge may not align with the arrival of data. so when they introduced “middle” of bit examples is to allow for a clock recovery
<ul>
<li>you can transmit just the data and design a circuit that allows for the clock to be synced/“calculated”<img src="../../attachments/calculated_clock.png" alt="calculated_clock" class="responsive-img" /><br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The problem with this is if you send a bunch of 1’s then they can also be read as a bunch of 0’s thus causing you to fall out of sync, <strong>BUT</strong> if you sent a pre-determined pattern of bits that both the receiver and sender know about at the start of signal then there could be a way to actually sync</li>
<li>This also sucks because there are a lot of transitions, which sucks for wireless transmissions in preserving accuracy moreover</li>
<li>This also sucks because it consumes more power, because the actual energy consumed in a computer is in charging and discharging capacitors and not in keeping a signal just high or just low
<ul>
<li>same way a car works, if you keep it at a constant speed it consumes less “fuel”, as opposed to starting and stopping</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Works best for fibre-optic and wired connection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Differential: Encode transitions instead of encoding values, 0 means EDGE
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t matter what you start with</li>
<li>how is this synchronized: we need a clock signal, because you need to know where the bits start and stop</li>
<li>Used by USB: they say they use NRZI, but they actually use Differential
<ul>
<li>the original USB used to send the signal, and its inversion because it had noise immunity, and had 4 wires if you included ground</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="reality-checks">Reality Checks</h4>
<p>There are a number of issues to resolve.<br />
Time:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the receiver really recognize bits, bytes (or later blocks)? - what counts as end of of data etc</li>
<li>Given a clock how do you send/receive the data (next)?</li>
<li>How do you get the clock (later)?</li>
<li>In the case of serial communication, slightly different meanings of Synchronous and Asynchronous:
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong>: Both <span class="math inline">Rx and Tx</span> use the same clock (frequency and phase). - they don’t need to have the same physical wire, but they should be able to decipher the clock from the data</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong>: $Rx and <span class="math inline">Tx</span> have independent clocks that have the same (or similar) frequencies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrupted data received due to noise on the channel.</li>
<li>Erroneous data caused by timing problems (e.g., slow reading, clocking differences)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="clockstime">Clocks/Time</h4>
<figure>
<img src="../../attachments/clocks.png" alt="clocks" class="responsive-img" /><figcaption>clocks</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>The Transmit and Receive clocks on a given interface do not have to be at the same data rate. (They usually are at the same rate.)</li>
<li>The serial interface figures leave the clock as external to the interface.</li>
<li>In some cases a local oscillator is used for the transmit clock and may be used for the receive clock (e.g., asynchronous).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 4 clocks in the actual system, at both ends, moreover they do not need to have the same frequencies. There might be some limiting bandwidth so, we set up our routers to be download heavy and upload light, because we want to allocate the bandwidth efficiently</p>

<figure>
<img src="../../attachments/serclock.png" alt="serclock" class="responsive-img" /><figcaption>serclock</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Why are there two registers in each direction?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receive</strong>: Processor may not pick up the data fast enough (Overrun, if mismatch in performance between the 2 connected devices)</li>
<li><strong>Transmit</strong>: Processor may not respond fast enough to keep serial data stream uninterrupted.
<img src="../../attachments/bitbyte.png" alt="bitbyte" class="responsive-img" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the shift register produces a byte output, it is only valid for that one bit time when reading from the CPU.<br />
It gives the CPU some more time, to not just be reading bit by bit but, by doing byte level operations.</p>
<h3 id="protocols-and-standards">Protocols and Standards</h3>
<h4 id="before-communication-begins">Before Communication Begins</h4>
<p>How do two systems that need to exchange information agree on a common language. The two ends must agree on the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing,</li>
<li>Control,</li>
<li>Format,</li>
<li>Data representation, and</li>
<li>Electrical signalling (signal voltages, currents, connector pin-outs, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication Protocol</strong>: A set of rules for making connections and transferring information.</p>
<h4 id="standards---who-is-in-charge">Standards - Who is in Charge?</h4>
<p>The protocols associated with communication structures are often developed in a sequence similar to the one listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry specification: some company (or consortium of organizations) defines the specification for use with their products.</li>

<li><p>Issues</p>
<ul>
<li>The data cannot be clocked into the receiver using the same clock as used for
transmission. That is, there is no wire connecting the clocks.</li>
<li>The designer (and user) of the receiver has only a nominal transmission frequency specification.</li>
<li>There is no (direct) phase synchronization between the transmit and receive clocks.</li>
<li>The clock generators in the source and destinations do not necessarily have the same drift coefficients. (Time or Temperature)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Design principle</strong>: The structure is designed assuming that the receiver has a reasonable estimate of where the bit should start (phase synchronization), and the goal is to sample the bit in the middle. Why?<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>To sample in the middle of the bit the following design characteristics are required.</p>
<ul>
<li>A reasonably accurate specification for the nominal frequency (e.g., (<span class="math inline">10000 \pm 5\%</span>) Hz.)
used to find the next bit given the current bit.</li>
<li>A way to extract the phase of the clock. (described later)</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="impact-of-clock-errors">Impact of Clock Errors</h4>
<p>If the clock rate drift causes the sample point to change by more than 0.5 bits in 10 (1 start, 8 data and 1 stop bit), the information detected will be corrupted.
- Therefore the frequencies of the derived clocks at the receiver and the transmitter must differ by no more than 5% (if there is a 10 bit frame)
- Note impact on the required clock precision if the number of data bits is increased.
<img src="../../attachments/slowclocks.png" alt="slowclocks" class="responsive-img" /></p>
<p>Just increasing the clock speed won’t fix it, since we have the same bit being read twice</p>
<h4 id="clock-shift">Clock Shift</h4>

If <span class="math inline">B\times\Delta T &gt; \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{f_{Tx}}</span> then the shift at the end of B bits is larger than 0.5 bits.</p>
<h4 id="one-eight-bit-implementation---overhead">One Eight-Bit Implementation - Overhead</h4>
<p>Overhead: (to be consistent with the previous definition) is <span class="math inline">\frac{\text{Number of non data bits in a frame}}{\text{Total number bits in a frame}}</span><br />
<img src="../../attachments/serial2.png" alt="serial2" class="responsive-img" /></p>
<p>There is the following overhead (per byte of data).</p>
<ul>
<li>Worst case: 7 data bits, 1 parity bit, 1 start bit and 2 stop bits, or 4 non-data bits for every 7 bits of data. (4/11 or 36%)</li>
<li>Best case: 8 bits of data, 1 start bit, and 1 stop bit or 2 non-data bits for every 8 bits of data. (2/10 or 20%)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="some-errors">Some Errors</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framing Error</strong>: An incorrect frame has been detected. In the case of one-byte asynchronous transfers, the indication of a framing problem is that the stop bit is incorrect (possible baud rate error) .</li>
<li><strong>Overrun Error</strong>: In a serial communication system, the data at the transmitter and receiver is transferred at a time convenient to the controlling processor. As a result it may be that the serial data will arrive too quickly for the receiver to process the data. It is also possible that the transmitter will be sending data faster than the serial channel can transfer the data. In either case, some data may be overrun by the data following it in the channel. This is an overrun error. There are two special cases.
<ul>
<li><em>Receive Overrun Error</em>: At the receiver, incoming data has overwritten data in SRin or RCV register.</li>
<li><em>Transmit Overrun Error</em>: Resulting from the CPU or the device writing to the transmit buffer before the current content of the transmit buffer has been transmitted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Parity Error</strong>: The parity of the received data and the value of the parity bit do not match</li>
<li><strong>Start Bit Error</strong>: when the line is sampled one half of a bit time after the edge of the start bit is detected, the value is not zero. This probably indicates that a false start bit has been detected, alternatively there may be some error in the assumed bit rate.<br />
<br />
A stop bit is essentially a MARK OR A SPACE BIT depending on what you choose<br />
Retransmission is the only one way to fix it, and it could even arise if your “stop” bit is incorrect but the data is correct</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="impact-of-parity-selection">Impact of Parity Selection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The selection of Even or Odd parity for a given application may depend on the character set usage. For example:
<ul>
<li>Some noise appears as short duration pulses. These pulses may imitate some of the timing of one or more bits.</li>
<li>Consider the cases shown in the figure below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Delete - 0x7F</strong>: In the even parity version in the presence of short noise pulses: 8 bits (7 plus parity) a single start bit followed by all 1s looks like a correct even-parity character. Howver, it would be quite unlikely that the signal pattern for the odd parity version of Delete would occur in the same environment.</li>
<li><strong>∼ - 0x7E</strong>: In this case, the even parity version is less likely an error than the odd parity version. Thus there is no ideal parity.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="../../attachments/delete.png" alt="delete" class="responsive-img" /><figcaption>delete</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The noise in these signals could lead to one deleting the next character when there wasn’t actually such a signal</p>
<h4 id="special-character">Special Character</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Break (and long break) … Forces a framing error.</p>
<ul>
<li>A normal break is usually a fixed duration in a given system. In some cases (with slow data rates) this break may appear to be some form of data that starts with a number of zeros. A long break often stays asserted as long as the user presses the break key, this assures that it will be a framing error.</li>
<li>An example of <strong>out-of-band signalling</strong> - and there is no way you can confuse it with any data.
<img src="../../attachments/break.png" alt="break" class="responsive-img" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Low for 2 frames, and at some point it is going to get a framing error on the receiving end. This way you can the receiver to a known state. It will not start looking for the next start bit until the line goes back to idle. By doing this we can guarantee this way that can re-sync</p></li>
<li><p>How would you know the receiver and transmitter are out of sync?
You would have generally have information in both directions, and there might even be some control signals</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="note-impact-of-stop-bit-mismatch">Note: Impact of Stop Bit Mismatch</h4>
<p>Consider the situation where the transmitter and the receiver use different assumptions about the number of stop bits. (Since all systems use 1 start bit there can be no confusion on this part of the protocol).</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">SB_{Tx}</span> = <span class="math inline">SB_{Rx}</span> There is not problem</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">SB_{Tx}</span> &gt; <span class="math inline">SB_{Rx}</span> There may be a bit of extra idle time between consecutive bytes, but communication will not be a problem.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">SB_{Tx}</span> &lt; <span class="math inline">SB_{Rx}</span> There is a problem. If the
transmitter ever sends consecutive bytes as close together as possible (<span class="math inline">SB_{Tx}</span> bit times separation) then the receiver will be looking for a stop bit (a 1) where there is a start bit (a 0) and should indicate a framing error. Even in this case we care not sure to detect an error because the line might just go idle, and we will detect the idle state as the stop bit</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the channel is bidirectional, then in most cases the number of stop bits used for the transmit and receive timing will be the same on one end of the channel. Hence if there is a discrepancy, one direction of communication will have the <span class="math inline">SB_{Tx}</span> &lt; <span class="math inline">SB_{Rx}</span> relationship.<br />

<li>Synchronous protocols use a common clock at the source and destination</li>
<li>A common clock can be implemented in two different ways:

<li>A dedicated clock signal can be shared (limits distances and data rates)</li>
<li>Data can be encoded to allow inference of the clock (typically Manchester encoding)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces overhead (e.g., no start / stop bits) <strong>BUT it introduces other overhead</strong></li>
<li>Eliminates problems related to clock skew, and you’re constantly syncing</li>
<li>Increases data transmission speeds:
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous RS-232 maximum of 19,200 bps (115,200 bps over short distances)</li>
<li>Synchronous rates can exceed 10 Gbps - high speed, ideal netflix connection</li>

As long as you have a well synchronized global clock, <strong>BUT</strong> it has to reach all the registers at the same fucking time. You can establish some timing patterns to ensure that: PLL or clock trees (where the distance of clock source and destinations is the same for all)<br />

</ul></li>
<li>Since there are no start/stop bits, extra hardware is required for synchronization.</li>

<p>Every manchester bit, starts at one point and ends at a different point, i.e. the encoding for ‘1’(1 to 0) starts at 1 and ends at 0, and ‘0’ starts at 0 and end at 1, this way when we detect that our assumed edge is wrong we can resynchronize<br />
Only when we have a transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, and we get the double stable signal we can synchronize and get our values.<br />
We’re not sending the clock because manchester has our clock encoded, and we can totally avoid clock skew.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-add-synchronization">How to Add Synchronization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Why is it needed?</li>
<li>Where/When is it needed?</li>
<li><strong>BISYNC Protocol</strong>: Modify the sequence of characters using hardware or software to provide block synchronization. (Byte synchronization is used to derive block synchronization.)</li>
<li><strong>HDLC Protocol</strong>: Modify the sequence of bits so that synchronization can be maintained. (Bit synchronization is used to derived block synchronization.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some ideas of these protocols have been implemented in the USB protocol</p>
<h4 id="bisync-protocol">BISYNC Protocol</h4>
<ul>
<li>Based on special ASCII characters: SYNC (0x16), SOH, STX, ETX, ETB, and DLE. (SYNC - Synchronize, SOH Start of Header, STX Start of Text, ETX End of Text, ETB End of Transmission Block, DLE Data Link Escape) A complete listing of the ASCII table is available in most texts or on the Internet (at www.asciitable.com).</li>
<li>A long string of SYNC characters can eventually be recognized and are used to establish synchronization during initialization.</li>
<li>SYNC characters are ignored (except for their synchronization characteristic).</li>
</ul>
<p>These characters are the reason why the ASCII ‘a’ is not 0 and so on. The larger block structures look pretty much like asynchronous frames, with start parts, data parts, error correction parts, and stop part.<br />
We cannot idle high, because if we’re using Manchester with no clock then we might lose synchronization and have no recovery way, which is why we send the SYNC characters.</p>
<h5 id="bisync-protocol-contd.">BISYNC Protocol contd.</h5>
<p>Header: may contain source and destination addresses, and/or a sequence number</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../attachments/seria15a.png" alt="seria15a" class="responsive-img" /><figcaption>seria15a</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Data: contains data being transferred (but not STX or ETX characters).
<ul>
<li>Send these characters (and all special characters) with a Data Link Escape (DLE). A DLE character indicates that the next character is to be interpreted as a normal (not special) character.</li>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>DLE | ETX would be used to send an ETX in the data stream and</li>
<li>DLE | DLE would be used to send a DLE in the data stream</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When the source buffer empties, SYNCs are inserted by the source and ignored by the destination, as long as the character prior to the first SYNC is not a DLE.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have ETX because the text can now be of variable length as opposed to asynchronous where we had 8 bits data top. If we want to transfer a DLE, we send two DLE characters (its basically the escape character), and to transfer ETX (we will send one DLE and then ETX).<br />
This is a character based protocol. Although logically we can assume that the clock can be detected out of the manchester encoding we still need some basic communication rate to be able to detect all edges.<br />
<br />
Overhead is still there, since we need DLE to escape some characters, moreover the obvious header of “header”, and if you’re only transmitting one byte, the header is extremely large. (8 bytes of overhead for one byte data).
If we have a bunch of DLE’s to send the overhead might be worse because we will have to transmit every character ESCAPED, but thankfully since the data rate is so high we don’t have to care.<br />
The checksum hopefully saves the day, when we do fuck up a frame</p>
<h4 id="hdlc-high-level-data-link-control-protocol">HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) Protocol</h4>
<ul>
<li>HDLC is based on modifying the sequence of bits so that synchronization can be achieved.</li>
<li>HDLC will never transmit a string of six ’1’s over the link, except as a special message to the receiver called a flag.
<ul>
<li>If the user data requires five ‘1’s (in one byte or in two consecutive bytes) the hardware sends five ’1’s, then a ’0’ and then the sixth bit of data.
<ul>
<li>0x7E (0111 1110) is transmitted as {9 bits} 0111 11010, where the extra 0 has been stuffed into the data.</li>
<li>0x3E (0011 1110) is transmitted as {9 bits} 0011 11100, where the extra 0 has been stuffed into the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When a receiver receives five ‘1’s in a row, it discards the next bit (if it is a ’0’) and treats it as a flag (if it is a ‘1’).</li>
<li>This referred to as <strong>bit-stuffing</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Bit stuffing is the major contribution of this protocol, by adding that 0, we can allow for resynchronization to occur as we discussed <a href="#typical-synchronous-port-structure-1">earlier</a><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The flag is a bit pattern that does not occur in the data, and we use <em>‘bit stuffing’</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q. Why did they choose 6?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> because it had to do with the accuracy of the clocks on that day<br />
Modern USB uses 6 bits<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Why don’t we worry about a long sequence of 0s?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> because this was the system where the line was idling high, which meant that we only cared about the long pattern of 1s and which is why we need to worry about going of sync more for a bunch of 1s than 0s</p>

<li>Note: No idle periods are allowed. Thus:
<ul>
<li>If the source FIFO ever empties, the transmission must be aborted. (An abort is eight ’1’s in a row.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The HDLC frame also has the similar header information (Addr would be 1 byte), Control (1 or 2 bytes), Checksum (2 bytes), and we use flag to use as a start/stop bit. The notion that we have to delineate the data we are associated with, the data itself, some error correction code and then delineate the end of the data just like BISYNC. We have the same overhead as Bisync, 3 bits if we all use the data. The control flag allows us to do sequence number and acknowledgements, and the size isn’t shown here (but the data is about the same size, 256 bytes)</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequence numbers:
<ul>
<li>are re-used acts like a circular buffer</li>
<li>are used to request re-transmission</li>
<li>Permits several messages to be sent before any ACK received</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Piggy back acknowledgement allows us include the data from one device to another, some information about data that we have already received
<ul>
<li>If we have regular 2 way communication, we will never have to send a manual acknowledgement between the devices, naturally through the data that we are transmitting</li>
<li>Instead of describing which frames you’ve recieved, you say which frame you’re expecting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>P/F: Poll/Final.
<ul>
<li>Can be used to poll (P) a unit for data or to indicate that this is the final (F) packet.</li>
<li>It can also be used to force (F) an acknowledgment from the other end.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A device will respond with next - 1 if it percieves that the data it recieved was indeed correct. Initially the next field would be 0, and once we get all of it, we’ll get 7</p>

<ul>
<li>Type 0: Used as an Acknowledgment (ACK) only. Useful when there is no reverse traffic on which to carry the acknowledgments.
<ul>
<li>in a situation where A keeps transmitting, and B doesn’t respond with anything, then at some point B will have to respond with sth, even if it has no data, and that is using this acknowledgment.</li>
<li>it would be a very short frame that just includes the next frame that it would be expecting, just control information, no data, maybe checksum</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Type 1: Negative Acknowledgment (NACK). The Next field indicates the number of the first frame that must be retransmitted.
<ul>
<li>yes we receieved the frame, but when we ran the checksum it turned out that the checksum failed</li>
<li>re-transmit required of that packet and everything after that</li>
<li>the default mode is to retransmit everything because once you experience one error, you experience multiple in a row</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Type 2: Similar to type 0. ACK all messages up to Next-1 but causes the sender to stop transmission. When ready Next will be either ACKed or NACKed.</li>
<li>Type 3: Selective Reject. Resend just the named frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we send the acknowledgement for frame N we assume that all frames up until and including N are good. If you don’t send the acknowledgement for frame 1,2,3 and then send the acknowledgement for frame 4, then the sender assumes that 1,2,3 and 4 were all good.</p>

<ul>
<li>Connection of the PC to the telephone (cheap ubiquitous connectivity)</li>
<li>Ease-of-use (a.k.a. plug-and-play)</li>
<li>each computer</li>
<li>Port expansion (bidirectional, low-cost, low-to-mid speed peripheral bus that expands)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Specific Goals:
<ul>
<li>Common connector (tree based, expandable); this goal failed in that there is more than 1 connector used.</li>
<li>refer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Overview Even at USB1.0 they did not establish this universal connector and had Type-A and Type-B</li>
<li>Type-A has made it into non computer devices such as extension cord with USB ports built in. (Since 2017, the USB A connector has been deprecated)
<ul>
<li>Has 2 data lines, 1 ground, 1B</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hot plug-in support, including automatic detection and configuration.</li>
<li>Support new and legacy peripherals</li>
<li>Higher performance than the systems it replaced</li>
<li>Low-power implementation</li>
<li>Direct power distribution for low-power devices</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The total number of devices to be connected isn’t like 255 because of the presence of hubs that occupy lines</li>
<li>A device can only be connected to a hub, and not another device</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When you plug a device into a hub, NOTHING happens.
When the hub decides its a good time to check, it send a signal to the device, and at which point the USB responds. Plug and Play depends on the hub to do most of the work</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Interrupts for USB are implemented using Polling.<br />
The receiver polls the devices to as whether or not they want to interrupt the device, and at which point the device says yes.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have a hierarchy of hubs, then each hub has to ask its correspondingly attached device to see if it wants to interrupt. Now the hub parent of the hub, has to ask the hub whether it wants to interrupt. This way there is a hierarchy and SUCKS latency wise.<br />
</p>
<h4 id="low-level-synchronization">Low-Level Synchronization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Data rate is specified by the presence of one of the resistors pulling up either <span class="math inline">D^-</span> (Low Speed) or <span class="math inline">D^+</span> (Full Speed). This is detected when the device is plugged into the hub</li>
<li>USB uses differential signal encoding but refers to it as Non-Return-to-Zero-Inverted (NRZI) signal encoding. (Zeros cause transitions and ones do not cause transitions)
<ul>
<li>They use differential but they say they use NRZI. USB NRZI === differential in the notes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bit stuffing is used to maintain enough clock edges to keep the clock synchronized. (Stuff after 6 consecutive ones in this case.)</li>
<li>(Block Synchronization 1) Start of Packet is transmitted as 00000001 to synchronize clock (lots of edges with the 0’s for bit/clock synchronization and then one 1 for byte synchronization.) Of note, line goes idle between packets and clock re-synchronization is required for each packet.
<ul>
<li>the 00000001 is actually a bunch of transitions for the zeros, then nothing for the last 1, and at which point you start</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Block Synchronization 2) Out-of-band signalling for end of packet. (Both D+ and D- are held at 0 for 2 bit times using the SE0 signal to force a violation of differential output values.)

<li><p>Each transaction is (usually) composed of 3 packets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>USB Token Packet</strong>: Selects the slave for the communication. The slave includes: Target device (7-bits), endpoint number (the I/O register in the device (4-bits)), and the direction of transfer (in or out).</li>
<li><strong>USB Data Packet</strong>: Payload information for the transfer - up to 1023 bytes in isochronous (special class of transfers) case, and 64 bytes for other (full-speed) transfers.
<ul>
<li>much like information frame</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>USB Handshake Packet</strong>: When required, this is used to confirm to the data source that the data has been received (and accepted) by the data destination. This is not required for isochronous transfers.

<ul>
<li>they only really needed 4 bits, but they transmit 4 bits in reverse order and then transmit the complement of these</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PID value 0101 (SOF - Start of Frame) is transmitted as a PID byte of 10100101 (A5)</li>
<li>Other values include SETUP (1101 transmitted as 1011 0100), IN (1001 transmitted as 1001 0110), and OUT (0001 transmitted as 1000 0111)

<li>In USB, a frame is used to provide some synchronization and to facilitate data transfer.</li>
<li>In most cases, the SOF packet will be sent once per millisecond to indicate a new cycle has started. The SOF token packet provides a number to indicate that this is the start of the nth frame.</li>
<li>Please note, the concept of frame used in USB (a sequence of activities that repeat every 1 ms) is quite different from the concept used in the serial communication section of the notes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>USB IN Token Packet</strong>: The IN packet can be used for Interrupt, Bulk, Control and Isosynchronous transfers (more later). The IN packet provides the address of the device and the I/O register (endpoint) to provide the data for the IN transfer.
<ul>
<li>for input - reading</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>USB OUT Token Packet</strong>: The same as IN except the communication channel being established is in the opposite direction.
<ul>
<li>for output - writing</li>

<li><strong>USB Interrupt Transfer</strong>: Traditional small volume transfers. There is no interrupt facility on the USB, so each device must be polled at a regular interval to see if a new value has been entered for action. During the interval between polling, a device could lose data, but every piece of data must be delivered, therefore there is a time critical component.
<ul>
<li>the interrupt method is curious, and is actually just polling in the background</li>
<li>latency is going to be low, so response time is pretty low, because polling is p fast as long as you limit the transfers</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>USB Bulk Transfer</strong>: Used by block transfer devices. Once the transfer has been started, there is no particular time constraint. Every piece of data must be delivered.</li>
<li><strong>USB Isochronous Transfer</strong>: Typically real-time data. The data must be read/written with a given rate. If one item is missed it can be ignored and processing continues. Every piece of data need not be delivered (i.e. lossy data).</li>
<li><strong>USB Control Transfer</strong>: Used to setup devices.
<ul>
<li>define manufacturer</li>
<li>clear buffers</li>
<li>load correct drivers etc.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>All isochronous data is put in the frames FIRST, and then the bulk transfer gets fit into the remaining space on a case by case spaces
<ul>
<li>if you get too much isochronous data, you might not even take the bulk data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BULK has least priority but they’re guaranteed and not LOSSY</li>
<li>Frame size in this would matter, and depend on the rate of transmission</li>

<ul>
<li>Originally specified to attach data terminal equipment (DTE) to a modem or data communication equipment (DCE)</li>
<li>Now used to connect computers to terminals, modems, (some) printers, almost any (relatively) slow peripheral</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The computer DTE, would have a different interface compared to the device (DCE).
<ul>
<li>You can see how the connection is un-symmetric that would allow one to work with the other</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Signals:
<ul>
<li>DTR: DTE is ready</li>
<li>DSR: DCE is ready</li>
<li>RTS: Is a handshaking signal</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it was based on modem tech, which is why some of the lingo matches eg: Carrier Detect</li>
<li>Fully duplexed</li>
<li>All other signals are control signals</li>
<li>The ring indicator was designed to work with the hand cranked phones that allows you to generate electricity to ring the phone on the other hand
<ul>
<li>you will get a 75V shock if you touch the Ring Indicator wire when the phone is ringing</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>2 grounds: one is to prevent against noise, the other one acts as the reference<br />
Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shield Ground is attached to the chassis (if it is safe to do so)</li>
<li>Signal Grounds must be connected which may lead to ground loop problems</li>
<li>According to the standard each device may have 50 feet of cable (100 ft. total)</li>
<li>A standard “D” connector is used</li>

<p>How do you do this transmission between these devices
1. You can cross out the recieve and transmit for each Other
2. But what do you do about DTR or RTS?</p>

<p><em>Note: change in operation at the software level.</em><br />
<em>Note: shield ground is not always included (as discussed much later in the course).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>At any time we have DTR we are going to feed it into its DSR</li>
<li>Any time we have RTS we are going to give to CTS</li>
</ul>
<p>This means both sides are always ready to whatever the fuck they want</p>
