This course is about some of the challenges faced by computer hardware designers. Up until now everything works as specified, but in real life, a computer may misbehave due to environmental factors etc that result in things like race conditions etc.


### Computer Interfacing
Designing the hardware and software necessary to connect a peripheral to a computer.

- analogous to designing a way to put a square peg in a round hole
- when most people think interfacing they think hardware but this course is a mix of both

### Sensors and Actuators
- Sensors: Convert physical information to electrical information
  - Chemical:Electrical - pH meters
  - Mechanical:Electrical - switches, strain gauges
- Actuators: Convert electric information to physical changes
  - Electrical:Thermal - Pelletier devices (cool and heat both)

### Interfaces
Connect the computer to the outside world, i.e. convert signals to appropriate levels and timing to permit interaction with the processor

1. *Signal Issues*:
   - Analog (range of values, offset calibrations, scaling errors), Digital (number of bits, interpretation of the bits)
   - Noise (both transient and permanent), Timing (repeated sampling causes to loose charge), Signal Levels (ground reference)
2. *Data Flow Issues*:
   - Information transferred: Occurrence of event, Data+Occurrence of event, Just data(asking someone the temperature, we barely ever care about why/how/when we reached that temperature)
   - Unidirectional or Bidirectional
   - Who is the controller of data flow + when do we know data is ready?
3. *Synchronization Issues*:
   - Level of Synchronization: Active Synchronization - demand oriented (interrupt when service required) or Passive Synchronization - request oriented (poll when service required)
   - Methods:
      1. Non maskable Interrupts
      2. Maskable Interrupts
      3. Tight Polling Loops (do nothing but poll)
      4. Periodic Polling (Do work, then wait, i.e. poll every 5seconds)
      5. Occasional polling (randomly unpredictably)
      6. Blind synchronization (reading temp when it might be changing)
   - Data may generated by source all the time/spontaneously or only when stimulated by the destination
